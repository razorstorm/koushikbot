LOL
i fixed a bug in a scala project at linkedin once
thats it
Ari Falkner
Ah
It looks fun
Jason
btw dolo tomo at 11
join
bring weeds and alc
Ari Falkner
Okay
Jason
kk
man dream was fun
since i was using 21st century tech
the ship was basically invincible
enemy shells barely make a dent in the armor
oh also had active armor
what they use in tanks nowadays
the armor is lined with explosive charges
when it detects a shell is about to hit it
the charges detonate outwards
and the explosion pushes the enemy shell a bit
and robs it of a lot of its momentum
its extremely effective
nuclear reactor so we can stay out at sea months at a time
and only have to resupply toget food
deslination plants
only possible with the massive power production of nuclear reactor
targetting computers
radar sonar
cruise missiles and SAM batteries
Ari Falkner
Lol much better than diesel
Jason
yea
you know wwii era submarines were diesel and electric
Ari Falkner
Diesel uses air
Jason
when surfaced they used diesel
yeah
Ari Falkner
So couldn't be under water
Jason
but when submersed they cant
so used electric
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Jason
but battery tech was shit back then
and can only operate for a little bit
before having to resurface and recharge
Ari Falkner
Did diesel charge the battery?
Jason
yeah
so they can only stay underwater like a few hours at a time i tink
when nuclear subs came out
it was a huge improvement
can now stay underwater forever
until run out of food
rocketry also big deal
tactically
i coulda brought back helicopter tech too
that'd tear apart the battlefield
battle of the
uhh
shoot what was it called
the giant tank battle
kursk
battle of kursk
stalemate woulda been broken so quickly with attack helicopters
there was a reddit story a while back
fiction story
someone wrote about a small detachment of US marines get timetraveled to roman empire
story ended right in the middle of a small skirmish where the marines destroyed some legionaries
apparently he signed with some small movie studio and was gonna film a movie from it
but that was years ago
not sure wehat happened
let me google
Ari Falkner
Wow
Jason
oh
it wasnt a small studio
was warner brothers
!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome,_Sweet_Rome
so its gonna be a big budget movie
im pretty excited
the premise is they have their equipment including some tanks
but no way to resupply
tactically speaking theres no way they can last very long
but if they play politics properly
and use very strategic shows of force they could bluff their way into power maybe
and then industrialize the society to help them resupply
i wonder which direction the author is going to take it
actually this woudl be a fun video game
you are dropped off in an ancient world
and you have modern equip
maybe you are given a lot of engineering equipment too
so you can slowly rebuild
Ari Falkner
Sounds like civ in a sense
Jason
nono
not strategic game
like
first person game
or 3rd person works too
you run around and fight enemies
would be cool to see how well you can do
say you get a rifle
and say you built up a small base so youc an reconstruct ammo
and you fight enemies with swords and stuff

story from first time i coded in js
i only coded in java at this point
and i thought
ok i want to print out a variable so i can debug
so i typed
print(variable);
i refreshed the webpage
and my printer turned on and started making noises
i looked over
it printed out the variable
LOOL
then i learned to use alert();
(this is before console.log was invented)
Ari Falkner
Hahahaha
Really? Console.log is new?
Jason
extremely new
it was a firebug feature for the longest time
and then chrome dev tools adopted it
and then eventually every browser started adding it natively
Ari Falkner
But it's not part of ecma?
Jason
dont think so
might be now
but not sure
i remember for the longest time you had to write code like
if (console && console.log) {
    console.log(
}
etc
Ari Falkner
Oh god
Because not all browsers had console?
Jason
no at that time
no browser had console
the only console we had was firebug
so if your user happened to download firebug
JUN 23RD, 5:09PM

Ari Falkner
He does other stupid things
He's the ringleader of the circuw
Circus
He passed this new education formulq
Which gives disadvantaged schools more money
Jason

it wont be ready for a long time
house sales are slow
also they wont move in for a while
gonna rent it out first
cuz too far from work
mom still works
Ari Falkner
Oh true
Jason
once mom retires they will move
Ari Falkner
Is it a nice house?
Jason
i havent seen it yet
mom just told me about it yesterday
Ari Falkner
Oh
Hmm
Jason
parents says dad wants sheep
maybe cows
and horses
Ari Falkner
Ride the horses?
Jason
but no pigs
cuz pigs dirty
yeah i said ill come ride them lool
Ari Falkner
Lol living on a farm is a lot of worj
But not stressful work
Just time consuming
Which is a good way to retire
Still get responsibilities and purpose
Maintain your character
Jason
its not a farm lool
2 acres isnt a farm
its just a big yard
2 acres prob like size of a small city block
Ari Falkner
Yeah
And no crops
Which is the major source of stress for farmers
Jason
irts like a bit more than half of the uber building
so about 1/4th of a civic center city block
nah more like 1/3
a couple cows at a couple horses
but nothing huge
yeah
its more of a ranch
Ari Falkner
I feel like that's not enough
Maybe for the cows
But the horses?
Jason
apparently the neighbor has a horse
and it just roams over randomly
but dad says
therse antoher option
theres like horsesitting services
where someone who owns a horse but doesnt have anhywehre to put it
would give ou the horse
you raise it
and they come and take it away on weekends to ride it
that might work
Ari Falkner
Lol is your dad gonna ride?
Is he gonna break them?
Jason
prob not gonna ride
break them?
break the horses
LOL what
ugh so sleepy today

Ari Falkner
