Apparently you told him something
Idk
So I just told him to message you.
He keeps bringing the girl up
We smoked a cigar.
Kenan is here.
Yeah
I hoped so
Really?
He's so drunk he just forgot
Yeah
The crowd is so off key
You were singing?
Wow
Nice!!!
Now you're gonna be in a good mood for awhile.
Really?
Haha
I can't believe my advice worked.
Not clever burn.
You were last night. Oooh
Show her your car
Demos

Funnel
Cake?
Wanna go clubbing?
Yeah
Now I'm just waiting to see where they will meet up tomorrow
He left and went to dinner without me :(
I have to work tomorrow
Oh. I gotta get my tool ready for ops at Vegas.
Question marks for what?
Come clubbing
Haha
I just bought the sticker pack
I worked hard for the money selling fruit
Why do you think they took a picture?
Ah
But they won't send it to anyone else?
Even if they did, can they arrest me?
Well, I'm not clubbing anymore in Vegas, that's for sure
I mean, they don't have proof that I presented them with the fake
Nah, I'm not salty at all about not clubbing. Just freaking out about my fake
As long as nothing happens from this incident, I'm fine
Haha, I don't care about no clubbing
I'm totally fine from now on just chilling in the pool
LOL
Haha
How?

If you got 3, then she deleted it
Haha, it doesn't matter

But any luck with your girl?
Haha
How dare
Going to bed?
Okay

I woke up at 12
Just woke up
Almost done
HAHAHA
Are you doing anything before clubbing?
My house has no food
I need to do the same
Nice
Now need to fix linting bugs
Just got 100% test coverage

Wow
Oh shit

why did you say ew?
Wait
WHat

https://code.uberinternal.com/D213229
Fuck this diff is huge
But yeah, this is crazy
Guillaume said he'd still review it
I know
Wow, the lot tool is only like 3000 lines
Nice
Are you going clubbing
Are you going clubbing
Yes
How was clubbing?
And watched Netflix
I invited a girl over
No
Yeah
It went okay
Idk
I cuddled a little bit, but she went home at the end of the movie.
Haha
What about ur girl?
We'll see if i want to move forward. She's grace gong
That's why im lukewarm
Idk
Im just so lazy
What happened?
Pretty much
This isn't taking any effort
That's true
Ah
She's not uninteresting, but she's super odd
Yeah
But I'm not sure i would want to introduce her to friends.
You met her
Idk
Odd
Idk man
We were having a good time, it it was really cozy, i had the fireplace going and i played a john wayne western with lots of beautiful scenery, and felt so relaxed, and i haven't been physically intimate with a girl for almost a year, so i just went for it
Too much effort
No
Artists are amazing
You should take them
Yeah of course
Are you going to bluegrass?
And a chance to show them GG park
Same as my parents
Wow
It goes until 7
You're old enough to know
Ask them
Oh shit
Oh yeah, i forgot your parents are chinese
My parents went to college in the 70s
My family has a problem with alcoholism
My dad got LSD from an RA
Shit, friday night
Probably because I'm such a lightweight.
Doesn't matter. I drink and haven't become one
That thing that Koushik has is crazy
Oh lordy
"Kdrama and chill"
Got a new tinder match
https://code.uberinternal.com/D215799
So embarressed
You guys left right when i came
At dssk
rekt
Nice!
Oh shit
I already cleared the socks and sandels attire
How to respond?
Should I saw "I still remember a few card tricks. I'll show you some of the sexy ones sometime"?
She said they would make her pants disappear
Oh shit
"Are you as sexy as your vocabulary?"
Should I sah
Shit, I hope that doesn't happen
She said "scintillating"
That's not how it works
Yeah, but not to a dick
Then I know I'm.in San Francisco
Oh god
She said she's making cookies for dessert.
It doesn't look like anything is happening tonight.
Shit
Should I ask if she wants company?
She rescheduled to Sunday because she said she had to drive someone home.
It's not happening tonight.
Nice response
Coming?

Hey big boi
Timeline
Sorry, just profile
Look at Lulu's profile pic
#rekt
And then I learned she lived with her boyfriend
I was ready to go all in
Gah, at Koushik's party there was this reasonably hot girl being kind of flirtatious
Otherwise, good plan
I don't have their address
Shit
Or just trick them
Yeah
DDOS their relationship
Then they have to break up
And they say no
Then quickly sneak in "are you guys not breaking up"?
And they just say "no"
Repeatedly say "Are you guys breaking up"?
Then do the same trick to her for "are you gonna stub your ex in his sleep"?
Oh true
really quickly
Wait
Just unblock the diff I sent you on hipchat
Very
I sent it on Slack
Sorry
Oh slack
Thanks!
Yes

Haha
Ring 1233B doorbell when u get here.
Is Sasha single?
Hmmm
I'm sure u have too
Do it in onsite and chill
I have a lot of shit that happened at the party, some good and some bad
We need to debrief sometime soon.
Dude
Almost
Did u bring anyone home?
One of koushik's friends sits down next to me. We start chatting and then I flirt and she flirts back. Then she talks to Koushik. Apparently she really was in to me, but she has a 20 year old minimum
Then idk. I started flirting with Sasha and that seemed to work but then the party ended. So idk
Yeah
Some.people I know
Idk
I have to go to a brunch in south bay right now
Ah
Why not?
Ah
I will be free this afternoon, though.
One on the left
Okay the 20 year minimum girl
She is 21
She is younger.
Maybe I should have gone for her friend.
Shit getting a girl in the bay area
But Tina was the one who was interested in me
But younger
Idk
?
You have to be age 25 with 30 years of experience, effectively
Just send screenshot
Nah
Can't see

Smooth!
Art galleries have so many hot girls.
Haha
Ready. Where meet?
I need to eat first.

Do you have drinks?
If that is the case, I will eat, stop by Grace's party to say hi, then come to your house.

No
If I asked, then probably
Lol
She would
It will be to my mom
I don't like my mom being too involved with my life.
Nah
Stronger things have happened in my life.

Let's from now on reverse our use of stranger and stronger and see if anyone notices.
Not you
Lemme call
No, at my place
Like 30?
Lol
We r driving
Yeah
I always find parking
What is good beach?

I accidentally requested Jochelle instead.
But I need a context
Interesting
Oh
Oh damn
How did u know I escalated it to him?
Message him
Say something about him personal
Get more personal.
He thinks barry is a bot
He knows it's you.
No
Kenan guessed it was you
Lol
Too late :(
Can't
15 mins
Not yet

Already coming :(
Yeah, but in interview
I give keys?
Hmmm
Take over interview
Be done at 11:30
Look at my calendar

Bombay would use a BST inside of a hashmap

She reminds me of bombay
04th Memphis
What time?
Yeah, sure
Where you?
At science fair
Where are we meeting?
Just use lot by house
Lol
I'm even more confused now.
This convo makes no sense.
Lol
Hahahahahhahaha
So apparently tongxue is a romantic term.
Oh nice!
Says Jing
Sound good
Kk
Leaving now
At hiuse
Naked
Or have Uber wait?
I come in
With Jing
K
But koushik and Robin are already with Calvin
I'll be there in 10 minutes! Follow my Uber trip by visiting https://trip.uber.com/v3/share/byeZd2LD1Z
I left
Maybe
IDK man
 Between whom?
What are you talking about?
When did I do that? Can't remember
What tell them?
Or Robin
Koushik wants to dinner first
Hmmm
With koushik
We have Nick's party during dinner
He knew Nick pretty well.
But Koushik wasn't invited.
The problem is it goes both ways
I feel like most people seem to just be neutral
Not a bad assessment
And think I'm super happy 100% of the time
So people have trouble reading me
So like I don't display those things either
Like if someone isn't super happy or excited, I assume they are depressed.
Which is something I've never felt
Kr is the weirdest to read
Hahaha
Not the same person
No, just a dops
It isn't a dict
Well.
Depressing
Check hipchat
A bit urgent
I need to talk to you about st sheriff.
You awake?
Check it when you get back
Not that important.
Not important
Basically a downstream service had a problem and you st sheriff retried a vehicle 10,000 times
BTW, why didn't you reassign page to me?
Wow
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Calvin assigned
Last night?
Got two hours of sleep last night
Which was interrupted by about 10 pager duties
What?
Where tf?
When going?
There yet?
On my way
Solved
Yes
They flake
We're just broing
Found some great music, btw
Yes
Do you know these grills?
I won't.
Haha
OMG, okay.
Oh, cool.
They sound baller af
Can't wait to meet them
Stories
*too
choices
Sorry, two much time writing post mortems
But that is good for excitement
They don't always make the best long term solutions
And then the dancing with frat bros
Like the fake id incidenet
From Koushik and Robin
I heard stories
No
Have to keep dealing with bullshit they keep getting themselves into
Too much work
But not necessarily for dating
The ones that are would be super fun, though
LOL
Ah
Oh nice!
What is her profile?
Not FB profile
But like what is she on paper?
Yeah
No.
Basic rundown
What are her caveats?
What does she present and offer
Like, what is her job? Economic status? Personality?
Ever dated university while working?
Sounds goodo.
Gotcha. Makes sense.
I care more about social status now
Hard to relate.
I hated it.
Maybe
A student just isn't an accomplishment for me
And being depressed
I'm just scarred of relationships now
Probably
So why the other way around?
When I was a student at Case, I didn't ever plan on dating a young working professional
Like why am I dating a student?
But it is also the theoretical aspect
His grill is an edge case.
So why would I look for students?
It is such a strange concept
Why?
He still has to deal with a lot of college bullshit and stuff
He also has to go through shit I wouldn't like to
Well she is super rich, and that is a huge component
1) Extremely smart and working on ground-breaking research that will fundamentally alter their field
I make a relatively high income at a prestigious company. So the reason I'd date a student is
Here's the question
3) Social skills mean I almost always have to date a station below
2) Bay Area ratio almost always means I have to look a station below
Hmmm
2 means don't date, just hookup
3 means fix that shit
1 is the only acceptable scenario
Looks you can get used to.
Well, personality and position play a lot.
If hot af and good personality, why not fwb?
Oh, one more serious question
Because no prospects
But wouldn't date them now
There were girls in high school that were hot af.
Because you get a net positive from a committment.
Because there could be another hot af and good personality with full time job later
In the base folder
Checkout gateways and entities
Yes
What do you mean?
Anyway, I'm glad you found someone you're interested in.
Show her chaima

He does that now

To what?

I don't know what that is

Ajf95@case.edu
Thank
So let's say u have a bunch of runners
Just made up a good interview question
You have runners dispersed at arbitrary intervals
Just a line
So the line from start to end is one dimensional
They are staggered from the finish line
One guy 6 miles in
One guy 3 miles in
So you have one guy at the start
So let's say there is a 15 mile race
But Tom could know Bob who could know Sarah, but Tom doesn't know Sarah
Not all the runners know each other
But only if they know each other
Runners can pass the baton from one to another
Each runner has a fixed mph they can run
Lol
And what is the course or the baton (who does it go to)?
With all the runners
How do you calculate the fastest time that you can run this racw
But how would u solve?
I give expected runtime as hint if u stuck, but that is later
I might be wrong, btw
Lunch when?
I mean, what is the point of doing anything really?
It really is an arimister drug
It is true though
Sartre is right
No.
No
Nooooooooooooo

PSC appointments?
We shouldn't be using FB messenger for this
Fuck
My tool also stores PSCs
Jason
You should take a trip to 301 Vermont before you begin building this tool
Ask the people that work there what they need
You have to give it to me in ISO8601
Now that you're working with my lot tool
St sheriff is having an outage
Hey
Gotta keep inviting Connie and Serge to the same parties
Fuck
Just entertaining
No
Answer question
Don't lol
The grass photo
Did I look that autistic for all of last night?
I think buzz ruined me
Not worth
Lololol
But good personality at least
And not necessarily the best reward
She wasn't into me at all
Should say grill
Other grills were fun, though
Yeah, I felt like there was a bit of tension and awkwardness though. Maybe I was imagining it
I was just full autist
Idk what happened
Didn't have anything to say
True
But I think buzz killed me
I guess I could have talked about philosophy again. She was interested in talking about it on Halloween. Though I mentioned "also sprach Zarathustra" and she was like "what" ?
She was like "what is that?"
Messenger keeps cutting off last word
Wtf
Pics of Seattle
Yaaaas
I don't feel like your values are aligned with the billion dollar challenge.
You shouldn't be spending travel reimbursements on expensive steak dinners.
I don't feel comfortable with this trip Jason
Thank.
Please schedule an emergency flight back to San Francisco to drop off at my house.
But I feel comfortable with you getting me a steak
Dude, not gonna mix up the space needle and Eiffel tower
So grills don't really visit either of them
No more shitpost in public
No more puns
Just posted the most autistic status
Lol
Is Microsoft nerdy?

#ItsMoreFunInThePhillipines
She invented new hashtag
Just took a peak at Jochelle's timeline
Btw
Lolololol
Sjw
Lol
But not much originality
Some good etl shit
And really good indexing algorithms
She has a really good memory
Lolololol
She never even used hashtags before she dated me
Hence the creation of these quasi sophisticated but nonsensical statuses
Or genuine intelligence
Versus someone like rainman who can only recite things verbatim if u specify
She can peruse her directory well
And good indexing
Yeah
Remember how you would say something and she would give a well substantiated response but it was never clear what her point was?
Her indexing is good but u can only know so much and predefined knowledge and arguments never map directly to an argument
Plenty of fobs speak worse English than she and still can do a lot better with conversation
Nah
Good choice
Jealous
Like, she would misuse idioms and metaphors, but her responses were never off kilter
Even jing, weird AF, didn't have this problem
?

Are girls better in Seattle?
I filed another phab task for u to do in Seattle
Jason
If u sleep with one and she turns out to be repulsive, close it as Wontfix
Feel free to close it as Resolved if u hook up with 3 or more girls
Please scout out the girl scene in Seattle
If you can't get anyone, close the task as Invalid and I'm demoting you to eng1
Omg did u see ryan koziel's status update, lol?
Shit Jason you're sabatoging me
This could be great
LOLOLOLOL
This is getting gud
Eh, not sure if I can go through with it
But it is a good prank
Lying gives anxiety
Don't know if this will work
Usually can be a driver
Shit they are planning camping trip
Life is hard, people are mean, grow a fucking pair
Were they never bullied in elementary school?
Just hate how sensitive adults are in Silicon valley
But if you're bad at Uber, we'll tell you that.
Like being byzantine is obviously bad
Anyone when they say Uber isn't nice enough
And vice versa
If you do something bad, I won't tell Rishit to tell ji to tell you
???????
Going where?
I watched a bit of the race.
Have to get project ready for LA, etc
But okay
Got to work a bit
Not sure
Oh
Now just sleeping in golden gate park.
4:30

Wtf
Not that funny to say "we fucked"  anymore
Hanging in apt
James, me, and Jing
James and Jing really hit it off
Talked about companies for two hours

Lololololol
They both got on my case for not being passionate about company vision
Company mission
They don't care..

Nah,  actually,  I can't massage
But might end up just needing to pass the whole time again
I like massage
rekt
On call
Well
Yeah
Yeah
Everyone accepted except chien
Why is Chien always getting fucked over? Feel so bad for him.
Sorry to have to disturb your labor day weekend :(
The appointments service needs to be shipped by Monday morning
Just for a directive from TV -
Wondered if I could somehow start working for Uber again at your team
Hey Jason
Rekt
How does that sound?
I will be the maintainer of St. Peter
Why is Uber so unreasonable?
Shit that's a deal breaker
I heard your team is cool with taking most of the week off
Can I take most weeks off?
This is exactly what I wanted
Maintaining a production service is so stressful!
Then I won't have time pressure
Exactly
Different than the real white,  corrupt western European culture you come from
We eastern Europe
You have no tough
You white people are so soft,  needing things to always be working perfectly
Byzantine was fair skinned like we
Speak to us no more
You are a white person
It fought off the delicate and corrupt holy Roman Empire and other Frankish and Prussian monstrosities
But you are more white
We may be white
Pics of chaima talking
I thought chaima didn't talk
Is it well written?

Lol
Is article well written?
What?
Read article?
Shit
Does psc tools include lots?
I wouldn't mind giving it up
It will need some love soon
Further development of lots may be integral to profitability than Funnel
It is more like
Yeah
Well
Yeah
But if you are going to own this psc tool thing,  it might be worth jt
I mean,  we both change it
Not toolshed anymore
If we spin up full service,  I think the frontend should be part of the service
Too much coordination
Maybe.  I think they should be the same owner
But as far as I am concerned,
That's what Uber platform recommends
Sitcom for example
Yes
Like having the frontend be so separate from the backend is a huge hurtle
That is simcom
And react frontend
We can have tornado backend
We don't need bedrock at all
I'm already convinced I'm a better engineer than a lot of them
I really don't give a fuck what they recommend
Uber platform is run by a bunch of fickle minded idiots
1) make write endpoint accept bogh
With toolshed would take 3 diffs
Like if the write endpoint needed territory uuid and we wanted to change to id
It makes sense to have them be the same service
Then 1 diff
If both part of same service
3) make backend only allow id
2) have frontend send id  instead
You don't have to setup frontend if it is part of diff anyway
Notice anything interesting about the trip link Ryan sent?
Lol
Repairing,  but they haven't failed everything back to sjc1 yeg
About the URL itself?
Remember that trips are active-active
James says that Nola might be a dca city
Ooh
Agree that we cover the bill for chien?
Planning now
Chien canceled dinner
He said he was sick
So. I asked him if he just wanted to hang out
Just said didn't want big deal
I think he might be avoiding us
Should I tell Amy it was canceled?
Happens
Yeah of course
Should I tell Amy to not make a big deal of it?
Yeah
She already asked to reschedule so I had to say to keep it low
You back today?
Where?
Or just "running around"?
Like jogging?
?
Like running around is childlike behavior indicating mental derangement,.
Jogging means either she is taking initiative to lose weight or is super insecure from me breaking up with her
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I first suggested flying to Hanifi
Just realized
So afraid of getting targeted
But he didn't want to because Muslim
Lol
I have a favor to ask
Hey Jason
Can you drive me to Bakersfield and back today?
Lol what?
Lololololol
Rekt
Lol
You think Jing has a husband?
What do you think of Hanifi? He is the Corona guy,  btw
No, it was 10%
Why can't you do?
K
So can't do anything else
My laptop battery is 20%
Okay, it is at 0%
We need to build our tools to work for web
I know
Forgot charger
LOLOLOLOLOL
U wot m8
Then you explained
I laughed
You told joke
I got the joke
Dude
Thank
Tomorrow
Was that a question?
Ugh
Fomo
So Mad I missed this
What about past experience?
What do he say exactly?
Wow.
But we can date,  right?
Lololololol
Assign date less interviews
Like maybe bad
No comment
Lololololol
Right
Lololololol
Given who is on your team,  I don't think you are experiencing temptation
I think it would be too weird
Yeah
Yeah
That would be funny
Lololololol
I think lots is psc tools
Yeah,  so that might include lots
Right
Well
Lol
*he
You should be working more than him
Well,  if Ankush is good engineer
This is why I want to go up the IC ladder
People are boring...
The end
So he canceled
But he didn't get sponsored
I said sure
Guy who asked to sleep on couch during f8
Don't really know
Whatever
Idk
The pictures are really the same level?
True
Why does koushik think my moving decisions are based on grills?
Just where to move next year
IDK yet
I can just get high
On Monday?
Anyway, Jason, what question did you ask?
Etc
I can play still
LOLOLOL
Thank
LOl
Where?
You at cam's thing yet?
Nick thinks you're lame
Jason where?
Just need to clarify some stuff
Can you talk for a sec?
One tent
Three sleeping bags
So I go shopping
Okay
Where is he?
Cool
Do we have graham crackers,  chocolate,  and marshmallows?
Anything Else?
Never drunk while camping before
K
Then again,  I'd be paranoid to drive for 3 hours with weed
One tangible perk of deep camping
Wish we could smoke
So hadx
I need to get the amount right
Then I just drink too much and then ptfo
Because for me, it somehow takes alcohol like 30 mins to kick in
Can I talk to you about something when you have a chance?
Mad about something but also don't want to piss people off
Meeting actually from 6-6:30pm
Yes
Fucking hell,  need a cigarette
Wtf California
Freaking out about this shit
Good
Is she mad?
Should I apologize?
Ugh
That's what I thought
Thank
Give
I need a chaima
Chaima rare
How?
I got a chaima
My chaima is ugly af
I got a chaima!!!!
Not yet
L'Chaim means "to life"
l'Chaima
LOL
Yeah
So Connie and serge happened?
Wait
So then yes
Why else happened?
Were there palm trees?
Nice!
What is?
We win
Wait where are you?
Why are you telling me?
Oh
Fuck off
She was the grill hanging with Chris jo in Vegas
Anyway,  remember Nancy Duan?
Because flaunting event wasn't invited to
Anyway,  talked to her about kareoke
Too sketchy
Coworker
Nah
Told her fuck that
Draw
Said I was her secondary draq
Said she would only go if Chris jo went
I convince Chris jo to convince her to go
She's hot af
Already maxed out head count
Then realized that she couldn't go anyway
Rubbed me the wrong way
Not worth the effort
Pics
Tell anyone what?
He was at uber for quite awhile
What made it bad?
Really???
Lol
Oh
Oh
Oh fuck
He didn't cause many outages or anything
Why did they not trust him?
So wait
Seemed fine to me
Idk
Yeah sure
He did a decent job
But he wrote OSM events
This dinner must have had some high up people at it
Fuck
Do you know what he did to deserve such a low threshold?
Like it seemed like he was a bit slow
That is surprising
Shit
But he did a good job with OSM events
Which seemed to take much longer than it should have
He shipped reengagement
Well
I've seen much worse from reputed engineers
But nothing too big
Like,  there was a few things with the code that I thought was pretty shitty
Don't confirm or deny
Lol
Someone showed you emails and shit I'm guessing
You have hard evidence?
Fuck Blake
You got insider company gossip
I talked to a shitty but hot af grill
Well your dinner was better than mine
Just pissed off
But she isn't dumb at all
Lol
I can make passive aggressive comment about not being invited
He gave me an opening?
Look for her
Nancy Duan
Etc
Came up to me at bar
Met at Vegas
So he got fired around the time Alicia broke up with him
Actually
But dude
You get over that shit
Like a girl is important but she shouldn't really alter your life like that
What if it was actually the pip?
But what if it actually had nothing to do with Alicia
Her photo is much worse than she actually looks
She's about equivalent to Jackie
She's not a 10 but she's not bad
Pip
Pio
Anyway,  you think that's why he changed?
True
Erodes a lot of confidence
On the other hand, spreading rumors among our team is pretty bad
Feel super bad
Giving the perception that we could all be fired, construing distrust among the people on funnel
Caused quite a few of the people I work with a good deal of unnecessary stress and unhappiness
Yeah
Man life is weird
Lololololol
in vitro veralis
LOLOLOL
in vino veritas
I fucked it up
Shit
Last night
Where?
4:30
Sounds good
We can chill afterwards
Shouldn't we just meet there?
I am near marina
I'll be there in 20 minutes! Follow my Uber trip by visiting https://trip.uber.com/1saU_ir-yJ0
Exact time
I will get there at 5pm
Won't make it
Not coming
What's wrong?
Too long?
It is 20 mins
No
Fuck
Run over?
What's the chance?
I'm with another group
With cirque de twerque
Is it worth?
Meet where?
Where meet?
Thanks
1639?
I'll be there in 34 minutes! Follow my Uber trip by visiting https://trip.uber.com/8-fNd5KnUK
You posted in group let's meet thrrr
Should I just meet at shabu?
It might take me 35 mins to go there
Oh
How do we get drunk then?
Try using Web browser
Not a host
Anyway
I can't help because I don't admin
But you are co-host
Oh
You never asked me...
Do you want me to handle anything?
What post?
And try using your mobile browser
5min
Appointments
Just took awhile
Realized
Yeah
Oh
Don't write it in tornado
Is this just indefinitely an intern project?
Hmmm
With Cassandra datastore
Has to be go
Never writing a service in it again
Then we learn it
It is not our final infra
Tornado is not sustainable
No one maintained lots anyway
You want to add the capacity field to the form,  Right?
What mean?
Status
What even
#ari
Just commented
This is too hard
Anyway,  #ari is not a thing
To remind you of a status
Chaima
🈶
Wo
Yaaaas
Apologize
Fml
Don't know
Thank
Can't send photos of my party cause no electricity on shabbat
So easy to get girls anywhere else
You don't realize
Dude
Her style is dated
I like
Lololololol
But have to worry about everything
Like can get grills
Dating is not fun
Just like so bad attitude
Just like chill out
So annoying
Girls in Cleveland would flirt with me all the time
Not sexy though
Girls that actually like you will do anything
Probably the zame
She would too
I don't feel bad for you
Flying back tomorrow when?
Yeah like 4am
Lololololol
Why no grill?
Speaking of which
You don't have a grill with you
You're drunk
Who cares
Santa Monica is like Hayes Valley
Nothing fun
LA trips are brae though
Atlanta should be easy af
Black girls are the best
They love to hit on guys
Hmmm
So you only like white or Asian?
But would be fantastic in bed
They are okay
IDK
And know how to show good time
I like all
But their waste muscles are super developed
Super scratchy
Can't stroke or anything
Is that hair is brae
Only problem with black grills
But if hot enough,  any race is fun
Etc
I have lower standards
But standards vary
Like so with Asian
Nah
Should fuck?
Fuck going to Ashland next week
Could tell it would be amazing
Never fucked but grinded
Lololololol
They will be a good fuck
Dignity too worth
Ever wanna move out of bay area?
I am weighing trade offs
True
Career can be had other places
But elaborate
What you sacrifice in career other places is marginal to what you sacrifice in quality of life here
Fuuck
Not complete shit like Atlanta or Cleveland
Amsterdam and NYC or tel Aviv are tech hubs
Yeah
I'm weighing cities with marginal drop-off
Dunno
Tech there is pretty good
Then move to NYC
For a year or two
Amsterdam would be fun as satellite Uber
LA might be fun after that
They are trying though
Silicon Beach is good
Exactly
Only in Silicon Valley is "look at your friend who works like 3 hours a day" a bad thing
Great life though
#google
That's trye
Request a ride
Maybe
No
Package
As I said before, my time at Uber is inherently limited
But marginally
Afraid also of slower promotions because of age
Wanna see what I can do to possibly increase it
After the one year that is
Like it is not tying me to Uber
Don't see that happening
But if I am not promoted as quick as deserve, then I need to fix
I know
But I have to prepare for possibility
My peers
Look it is a crap shoot
But manager also has limited perspective
I am founding a new program as angie
So I am seeing how an eng2 conducts themself pretty easily
*with angie, not as Angie
lol
One week in Parisa
One week in Germany
Okay
So I wanna take 2 weeks off
So I can fly for free
I already have 60,000 miles
Come with?
So am?
Soam?
Also can Ryan not spam the group whenever we try to have a serious discussion?
Yes you are
But what do you mean by soam?
Oh
Yeah
Latam is next
When is their dry season?
In latam?
They have wet and dry seasons,  right?
Have parents visit you
At pride
They can march too
Remember that Uber has a float
You want to be part of it?
K
Runescape music too
Only 1.5 minz
Made and narrated
Check out the Sphinx movie
I made that in 2008
Yes
My voice hadn't dropped yet
His was 8 years ago
I was in 6th gradd
The Oscar this movie one?
Oscar?
It is made of clay
Pics of this
Lol
I didn't actually want to go clubbing
Just wanted to be invited
Koushik was mad at dhruv for enabling jihui
Lol
True. Allen was bad,  though
True
IDK
IDK
Met some people at the parade
It's not what it sounds like
No one goes in the pool
Kinda hitting on me a little,  but think it's just platonic and need to stretch my boundaries anyway
Just a bar with a pool
I know what you're thinking
What?
True
' Like calm down she's here for a summer'
Exactly dude
Fuck
That was ironic
This hot German blond put sunscreen on me
Then this other guy she was chilling with went dancing together
Think she was taken
Just European af
Or maybe thought I was gay
Yeah
Don't make a big deal of it
How it should be
I love European girls
They flirt and touch you
Just like guys
Lol
Also getting into waking up early
Not that early though
Physiologically not possible
BTW,  Kiki + buzz?
Buzz at 9:30?
Fuck that shit
Lol
German grill wasn't hitting on me
Just saw my neck
Had real sunscreen issues
🈶
Send me voice recording of chaima talking
So who braed?
🈶
Angie is no
No response yet
Already asked
Already asked
No
I won't do that
Just rude af
This is brae
Why agree to reservation?
It is still brae
Not saying it never happens
Just annoyed because because I never do that
I say no upfront or go and commit
I did
Doug too
Already done Ankush
Chien is no
Lol he is allergic
Ugh
Messaged Connie instead
Just messaged him
Lol
They are a unit now
I messaged Connie about them both
Idj
Idk
Cool
Cool
Congay is Connie?
9th and Lincoln
Screwed up bad
Was with Amy in the elevator and complaining about another team
There was another grill in there
Ugh
We get out and the other grill walks up to me and says "I strongly advise you to exercise caution next time about what you say in public places, like elevators."
Doug
We have 7
I reserved 7
Ankush is vegetarian
CCog can't go
It's okay
Quotes from chaima
Hello!!!
Lololololol
He's a badass
Second big one
Yes
Idk
Auth
Oregon
Lol
How is LA?
LOL
Yeah
Robin might be staying with parents
Why driving?
Bring chaima?
So awesome
Has chaima ever met a moo?
How is that a question?
But can chaima say moo?
They are almost moo
Yaaaas
We also show chaima bison in Golden gate Park
Should we buy a moo?
Really?
You're parents are great
They could sell their house and move to Cleveland,  buy a 4 acre estate with a mansion with 9 bedrooms and still have half the money from their sale left over, lol
Could even do something similar by moving to northern California or southern Oregon
Why are you traveling with an owl?
Vicky Hoo
Wow, your trip really is a sausage fest
Can't think of any
Cool
Where is chaima?
you know what else is busy this weekend?
l'chaima
yaaas

What think?
Whips out dick
Lol
Fomo this
Rude af
Like Kevin M Roth but not move to Los Angeles
That's his problem
Oh
Gotcha
If he mentioned guys,  you wouldn't have walked away
I mean I can go all university "oppression" and positions of "privilege" but I think that's unreasonable
He wasn't being classy
Or he was just trying to hit on people
Either way,  don't feel bad
Well
Must be what girls feel like all the time
Lol
Because he was offended or just wanted to move on to his next potential?
Well
Why did he walk away?
??
Uh lol
?
This is some LA level drama
Lol
Koushik is at anime con
It is very potent but very superficial
Let's move to Los Angeles
Yeah
Bare?
So focused
Told ya
The problem with SF is there is no breathing room
The network is so small
So competitive
Me with dating
It wears on a person
*same with dating, not me with dating
SF is too small to be so competitive and pretentious. It doesn't work
Matt
That's true
I feel like it is hard to branch out when everyone you meet is the same
Like,  it's that LA or nyc are epicenters of various industries
Also,  it seems like all grills care about when traveling is food
Don't understand that
Why?
But I wouldn't travel for it
That's worth it
Thanks siyao
Buttered on the side
But can't get full how dare?
Hey,  it is good toast
That was good enough for me
Meanwhile,  I had four slices of toast tonight
Just a French baguette
Looks like jihui
Same hotel room?
Who?
Which one are you gonna fuck?
The one closer to the camera looks hot af
No,  you chill
This is LA
Stick them in the fridge for 30 mins
Nah
Doesn't matter
If they aren't chill enough,
You can do stuff like that with low effort
🈶
Okay,  going to sleep
Call was accidental
So you admit there is a new Ari
Wait
High?
It's the beginning of the month
Lol
Gotcha
Back to portlandia I guess
Thanks
Was guy in video the LGBT?
Oh
This is degrading too quickly
Good night
Never thought that
But he actually does
Talking about actual gay guus
Why have different way of talking?
Not talking about Ryan
Why talk like that?
One part of LGBT I never understood
A samurai champion once said
Eat only the amount you need to stay full
And eat plain and bland food
Why no tho?
What do tomorrow?
What uses can I apply it to?
Okay
Dude
Thanks for the info
Never get fat
More beautiful than cali
Was 97 degrees
I like
Not really
Wanna see if Brazilian grill is actually cute
About her being cute?
Lied?
Why not?
Really?
So you don't think he fucked Vicky either?
Or about it happening at all?
Oooh
You're in LA with Vicky
Did you talk about with her?
And has a boyfriend
That's really low actually if he lied about that
Like lying about a grill at anime convention is whatever
But Vicky is friends with the rest of us
So essentially claiming a friend is being unfaithful
Like why not?
I think Brazilian girl is plausible
Lol
I met a stripper off a plane,  and my game is much worse than his.
But yeah
So if lying about Vicky,  that's bad
Does Vicky know?
So he might not be lying about Vicky?
Oh
Could be because he broke it off with her and she's salty. But I doubt it.
We should hang with Vicky more
Quality person
Why not hang with Vicky more?
Jk
You did
Scroll up
Yeah
Not much
Wish I had tickets for a play :(
Just walking downtown
Mom's birthday tonight
Yeah
So will have car at office
Want ride?
Gonna get up early and drive back to SF
Also,  in terms of doing more,  down for cultural festivals?
Also plays?
And then good music and performances
Like Russian,  Greek,  etc
Lots of ethnic food at them
I've been to Greek and Russian
Really?
It is really nice to have parents nearby
Even as adults,  it is unsettling
I have no familiar landmarks or figures I sought comfort in as a child.
It is easy for me
SF isn't home
Ah. I sometimes rely on parents for emotional support
But anyway yeah bigger for you because bay area is home
For me bay area and Amsterdam are no different
When wanna go?
Lol
Maybe
Maybe nyc or LA will be more developed by theb
Yeah
Is that a prevailing reason?
GA?
Oh
If move to Amsterdam, you should sell car
Well nothing in Amsterdam I know that
Where Park?
I know I'll be selling mine
Probably
Ah
What about steering wheel?
Wrong side
Okay
Wait
They don't drive on left side?
Oh
How far is to Paris?
Yeah
Lol
Not worth for me
Trains are 3h
Car is 5h
Trains are faster
Just rent
What?
Where?
But I figure
Especially since Honda Accord
Lol
Same
That's terrible
You come this late sometimes
Cool
Will do when get to work
Hella late today
Hell yeah
Nah
10 mins
Wait,  can you transfer hvs by sharing food?
Herpes simplex
No idea
Haven't eaten yet
Lol
Probably havs
Might not
Lol
Haha. If you don't have sore now,  we are safe
Cool I eat
Have?
Reply to group chat
Mentioned you
Amsterdam has lower paycheck
Heard if you move they cut your pay
Idk
Heard from someone else
You should ask Blake
You're Bros with him
True. Well,  not close enough with Pepin to ask
K
Learn so much about maintenance from her.
You could take your car hobby to the next level
LOL
cute mechanics
That would be a good relationship
Probably also pretty easy to get her
You know enough about cars, work in a company related to them, probably are in a higher class of society, and this is LA where grills outnumber dudes, so getting a girl is easy af.
Yeah
That's like the inspection you want if buying a used car
None
21-point is pretty moo
130 is the actual impressive one
But if she is a certified mechanic, she obviously had to do a 130 at one point
So unless her skills have atrophied, she will know how
Right
If she is
Then would hot af
Well for you it would
Why nah?
True
Well she can make analogies to car parts during sex
Cow wins
Idk
Maybe Jing
What doing?
Not had for a Saturday
Hung out with a bunch of grills all day
Lol
Pretty decent
Only one or two local
And one of the SF grills was marketing
So maybe fucked up there
Sure
And said something derogatory about how I didn't need a marketing co-founder
But I was talking about startups
Fucked up
Okay,  going into tunnel. Chat in 3 mins
I met early oj
K
But point is
They were friends of jackie's
Chill this
What doing?
Lol
I come?
Brae
You said come in group chat
Ah
Who with? Ryan and jacq?
Jk
Tfti and fomo triggering snaps.
And she's back in NYC tomorrow
Only link is Jackie
Rip
Can't introduce to Jackie's friends I don't think
Barely know them
So easy to meet cool grills in NYC.
Fuck so fucking depressed right now. Just thinking about the Holocaust
When hitler first rose to power,  the police did this shit to Jews
They'd stop us for no apparent reason,  demand identification which included that you were Jewish,  then throw you on the ground and beat you thoroughly
Blacks are getting the same treatment that Jews got several short years before the Holocaust
Lol
You always host events at koushik 's place
Of what?
What up?
Don't want to go somewhere different?
I'd also be willing to take it up a notch.
I'm on a good part of my digestive cycle.
What cuisine haven't we tried?
Like one week I get full super easily and everything makes me sick
Second week I get hungry super easily and love food
I should.
No.
Like on the weekend I feel terrible but am at work and focussing on coding, so don't really notice
On weekends trying to enjoy myself, be active, etc, so that's when I care
I think I can just get on a pill and it will all work out
I only care on the weekends.
Also, can't wait to hear what Angie's french laundry experience is.
Fuck
Just realized in multiple RFC 's and PMs I've used altercation instead of alteration
Tuesday night?
Oh crap
Can't get high Wednesday night
On call then
Where?
Oh shit
Jade
Like $400
Blake is selling a 3 day pass for outside lands
Yo
Wonder if we buy it and alternate days
Not ideal but it is something
So we both save $80 for this
But can't go together
Cool
Let me know what you find
Where find?
Oh fuck that shit
Growing up in Bay area is unfair advantage
Standing in back
Driver all hands
Did you leave your backpack at the bar?
Thanks
You're trying to give me fomo,  right?
Raymond did last minute
Drove aaay
Drove away
You didn't let me
I was about ti
But left before I could get backpack
Where'd you go?
Jessica?
Ah. Even Jessie?
No
She thought Jessica was gay?
Lol
Still don't get what was so great
Pls
What does time for chaim mean?
How do you fab serve in an adhoc box?
Jason
Dang.
I need to serve
But it cannot create logging files
lol
Thanks
Thoughts?
He keeps saying we need to go
Konstantin trying to come over to your place.
Lol
Uh
I talk to koushik
What do I tell him?
Who else was there?
Koushik says they are ripping
Lol
Ah
Well
For awhile
No
Koushik doesn't want to
Don't think he likes kon
Not sure if I believe him
Hung out earlier
But whatever
Seemed like he wanted us to leave
Poor Ariel
Oh
I know
Gonna hang out with her soon
She wanted to
Kon was hitting on Ariel
What?
Super fake
She flirts heavily with everyone
Yeah
She asked me if i was comfortable with it
I said I was
Well
I'm not happy with kon either
But he is too drunk
Made women and staff there uncomfortable
Had to drag him out
Want to send him back to Connie
I took him to a bar and super inappropriate
Way too drunk
Spit cherry in drink on ground
During my birthday I never harass women and make my friends embarrassed
I don't care
But serge is there
So is okay
At this point I wouldn't trust him with Connie
No matter how drunk I am I never make people feel uncomfortable
I have a few times in college
But not gonna 1:1
Hmm
I will be find
I get its his birthday
But I'm not gonna hang out with him
Like if he is in a group
I'll talk about it on Monday
True
I can control myself
I will pass out before I make someone feel uncomfortable
But he ruined my reputation at one of my favorite bars
I don't quite agree
I've been totally unaware of my surroundings
Well I'm not sure about that
Alcohol doesn't inherently make you a dick
If it is,  it means you're a dick but usually can't control it
Well true
Just salty because my reputation is at stake
That's true
But still makes me wary of hanging out with him
Yeah exactly
True
Yeah
Instead of hanging with my friends I had to prevent this guy from harrassing people. I'm not a dick like this to people on my birthday. You're right, I won't write him off for this, but still plenty pissed.
Konstantin is chill
Hanging out more now
Yeah,  you're right
No
Slept on my couch
Pls
Lololololol
Told him about Jing
God.
So annoying
Would be such an excellent fuck
She's extremely skilled
Said she hasn't fucked in 4 years
So probs just let it go
Knows how the male brain works inside and out
But dated bf for years
Alpha Andy's girlfriend is ugly af
Not as bad as jochelle though
How so?
Really?
Lol jeez
Jochelle was fat
Is her name Cindy yi?
Lol true
Lol koushik
We could have just all chilled together and smoked
Yeah
I know
Whatever man
Just ironic that he used to complain about white Knight
Typical
That's the thing I like about James
Like he's a huge dick
But he isn't drama
Lol
Like we sometimes get mad at each other
But never have drama like this
Like he never prevents a party
Always willing to negotiate and compromise
Due a fair share of the apartment
When rates bottom out
Get a Hella cheap 3 bedroom
So we can start our lease in like November
Might actually keep living with him
His best friend wants to live in the city
Who i really like
There isn't logistics
They are making stuff up
Like James has parties all the time when I'm not there
I don't give a fuck
And then I don't get invited to shit because he is mad about the guy who I'm hanging out with
Even if James party do not clean up
It's like 10 glasses to wash
Who cares
Yeah
James is never salty or whiney
So is okay
Actually great roommate
Robin would be chill
Connie and serge are cute together
Wouldn't say Robin and jacq are
They are good together
He probably will move out
He's in love with jacq
And his roommates are shitty
Like feels comforting seeing them interact
My parents are like that
Yeah
Not many relationships in the bay area are like that
My brother is a bit like that with his girlfriend
But more limited
Because going off to college
So kinda doomed for failure
Yeah sure
So anyway
Yeah sure
With md
With me
Ariel wants to hang out sometime
Or said so last night
Idk
Because friends?
If we do
Anyway,  I can buy some tabs from her when we do
Not with group
Doesn't sound bad to hang out
Like I know at the end of it
I will like her a lot more or a lot less
She's is so weird
It is a bit terrifying to imagine what she's like 10/10
Depending what shit she tries to pull
So I can fuck with her mind a bit and play around
Make her super confused lol
Or just have a genuine hang out session
But I feel by virtue of being weird too
I understand her brain
What?
But not the most informative
Like bad
Lol
This channel sucks
Not Oscar material
I'm just kidding
Being ebs
Konstantin didn't understand a this joke
Anyway,  make group chat for tripping?
When? 7
Oh
Might want to soon
Next weekend or maybe during outside lands
That would be chill
Not yet
By end of Monday,  will have
Let's get a house
Konstantin can sell them to us
Each is like $10k
$50k is a huge house
Family
Family owns houses
Why is koushik dating that Indian grill?
Such a left swipe
Found a picture of her smiling with her mouth closed
Still a left swipe
Okay,  she's all right. But not great
Worse than Bombay
IDK
Yeah
I wouldn't care
But she's fine
And her teeth are straight af
Like she's not a model
Uh
Not bad at all
But then he disses Bombay
Okay,  this is getting petty
Why would I know?
Oh nah
That would create hella drama
I don't even have her number, lol
Just confirmed that she didn't block him
This is good content
Nah
Love it. Are you with kon?
So be there in like 1 hr
Bojack horseman

I saved it
Why no reply?
Brae af
Pls respond
Thank
Jason come out and tell the hostess you have a table
Dude
At party today met head of sales at square
Ross overline
Lol
Also  never saw cheri Kim but I did notice that the invite list for this party was super large.
I don't necessarily think that she's real
Grills get invited,  they do not worry about inviting
And why does this girl invite so many friends if she never shows up?
Okay,  it is true that girls also invite. But her notion of inviting and not showing up is weird.
Something tells me that she had no intention of showing up at your Halloween parties
It's classic networking. She's can make a good business of inviting people to events
Add me as a friend on fb,  I'll get you into to tons of cool parties in SF
That's generally how you get into the underground rave scene
Befriend and network and follow Cheri Kims and club owners
So it was worth not immediately cutting it off
I mean it worked. She would be a really good fuck
LOL
No
But even more complicated
Then waited awhile. Found out wasn't happening, but by then harder to cut off
So if I try to break it off, she might offer to fug
Wonder if should indulge
It would be gr9
LOL true
Lol Jing has a migraine
Can't break it off today
Dude give me $100
Lol
No
I mean the cost difference between the two days
Bryce?
Oh that
Naaaas
Bryce Lampe?
Woulda come if you invited me earlier than 2am
Lololololol
This is hilarious
Four dudes have so much drama
Just another aspect of my life that could be a TV show
Like he just gets mad and goes to bed
But still no drama
Like it doesn't escalate.
Lol
Never have drama with James
Even though he acts dramatic af
And next day start over
Stop ruining the sitcom
Jason
Ya think
?
What escalate?
Yes
I will ask her
No reply
Go to her house
Idk
No
Fuck
I wanted to come over
Lol
Wait why instructions? I don't have ribs
What does that even mean?
Okay,  how long cook for?
Do I have to wait till 5?
Oh
Okay
I thought party starts at 6pm
Wait
I'm coming over while ribs cook then
Ryan is where?
Can I still have it on by 5pm?
Will cost you $180
SMS
Use stub hub
no
Well
I used queuein. Probably can get another
What I used to find Beverly. P2p ticket sales
No search for outside lands bro
Lol
Know what happened to kon?
Besides,  I don't think Google gives interns return offers.
He wanted to apply again as a pm too
Intern. But I don't think his internship was over
Hmm
Well nyu starts on August 28
So guessing his internship wasn't over
He said the day after his party that he was about to start something new
As in new project
Not like life new
Definitely. Read the comments on his status
Hate this
LOLOLOLOL
Nice
You should have sent yourself a cow
Good prank
Submit a passive aggressive diff to dispatch gating the fare expiration logic to for devices in GPS coordinates inside India.
When is drive?
Tfti
Just for moving event to 3pm
What is that?
Who is Aaron?
Going to party.
Oh cool
Sent invite. IDK who
Grill invited me
But looks like sausage fest
Lmk if want in
Gotta pay $5 to cover guac
Don't come
I'm getting cancer
Jason
Eiman's wife opened up a cafe in North Beach
Wonder if we should go there
I have car
Oh so ditching jade?
I meant then
This is why I got a 2 in communication
Cool
I realized how over budgeted my deadlines are
And you think funnel is slow
Used to be referrals,  built the contact picker, now uberpool
Lol
They spent 6 months on the contact picker
Like I used to complete deadlines on time and fuck around half of the day
Now I work super intensely and almost finished my two week sprint in 1 week
Next week is gonna be fun
Nothing to do
Nah
Take tasks from my tl
Yaaaas
Lol
I thought they withhold rsu for taxing
Jason
Jade didn't reply to chat
Bridge
Bring
You are my emergency contact.
Rental application
Thanks
Stupid af
Some salty religious kid
Maybe this was early work before he was good
When did he write?
Oh didn't read author
Like it was intriguing.
But when you finish the book, it's just like "okay...."
But think about it
The Space Odyssey didn't really make sense either
Read the book once and watched the movie twice
Only the second time cause a girl I liked in college was obsessed with it.
Only half of the last one
No
Just robot trilogy, I, Robot, and The Gods Themselves
I read books more than short stories
Nothing
LOL
I don't have weed
We can get drunk
I dpm
I worked smarter and finished my sprint
Now I don't know what to do.
Yaaas
You're so right about work smarter
Hmmm
Fun
Ah
Got it.
Sounds good
See you at dinner
ugh
So annoyed
Just going to develop the MVP in Android
I'm done
And do the chatbot MVP in parallel
Writing android code
Talked to nick
Gonna get started in Android development tonight
And hopefully by end of week
If I took all the time I spend drinking and getting high and do Android instead,  I can easily do this
Nick wants a diff by EOD tomorrow
Yaaas
Good
I thought the prank was *cheesy**
Entertainment I guess
Rishit didn't even mention mentoring during perf
What even
Yeah
Not even manager anymore
Right
Well it is career goals
Also,  what do you mean?
Now I have all the people asking me questions about everything but not the perf report to show for it. Well,  I guess,  when I'm in a jam they'll help me
I'll see when it benefits me
But I haven't done jack shit for him. Pay it forward I guess
Nick put in a lot of help with Android today
True.
Yeah
Yaas
Needed more shits
Dude
I destroyed my chaima
Well
Chaima doesn't have social capital
Naaaas
How do you know if I like chaima?
Yeah by chapter chaivma says there is an exemption
Faa never thinks anything through. They just WING it
Ugh
I hate the faa
Their shit just shouldn't FLY
Have to get out of SF
This really gets to me
Fog
Naaaaaas
Fuck so depressed
Just shit. Evaluating life,  etc
What is that?
And how much per month?
Oh
I was in Oregon
Yaaas
Just called their leasing office
Great building.
Didn't compete with $3600
No
Yeah
I only got $4200 when I was there
Ava parking is like $400 probably
Yeah
You'll pay another $250 for that
Sounds about right
But what about parking?
That's what I thought when I looked
Or you can keep car at koushik
Or stanyan
Just Uber to it
Yaaaa
?
Oh
Lol
Moving in with van ness
But what happened to 3 bedroom?
You what mate
But is okay
He is bringing chaima with hin
Just might forget your name
South SF is closs
Just super foggy
So sometimes you just get lost
But people find you after like a year
So not too baf
Well most of it is. But not where I'm considering
South SF is just shitty and inconvenient
Oakland is inconvenient but not shitty
Lol
Not like Oakland
Oakland varies drastically
Oakland varies so much
Can't really generalize it
Like SF has neighborhoods which say that they're different
But overall, pretty similar
Yaaaaas
I know
Does he not like cows?
Why did Ryan leave?
I had a dream that you came into the office smoking a joint.
And the office had a balcony
And I was like "Jason,  get rid of the joint!!!"
And you handed it to me
Rude
And the clothes burned up to her waste.
But her legs were fine.
But she got mad, so you, on her behalf,  drenched me in soda
And I like threw it on the deck
And then it turned out to be a girl.
Home
Lol
Emily happen?
Rude
How was?
Yes
Come
It's fun
Thank
6
Oh nice
2K?
Not bad
Fuck
So $2220 per month
Lol no I included parking
Def
Oh nice!
I wanna get there early and just kick back at lake
Good
Even if I do bail, which I won't, I'll pay my share
Are you really gonna move the dates up to accommodate Connie?
Yes
In Cleveland, when people say they are going somewhere, they show the fuck up
This flakiness is West coast bullshit
While I don't respect Allie for what she did, I also don't respect flaking either
Koushik and Robin flake too much
Sometimes he does
But not too often
But if he lived on the east coast,  he would be considered flakey
IDK how often you flake
Like you don't commit that often
Do you need Jackie to confirm?
http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/apa/5718287678.html
Pretty good
She's renting me an apartment
Yaaas
Best way to sell an apartment
Is this too douchey?
Feel like it's better to share my salary and appear douchey than be indistinguishable
Says she wishes could cone
Come
Jackie has a conflict
Lol
Because believe is bad
Jews believe the celebration is bad
Atheists don't believe is bad
Just neutral
Celebrating false prophet
Like maybe the concept is bad
But not the celebration
Lol
Joint mortgage
I'd rent a room
Maybe we buy together
Are you actually considering?
Oh shit
If you're looking for a partner, might wanna get in on this
I think that fucked over my dad
Yeah true
This shit can't be written down
Jackie
No
Then we get there at 10am
Lol
Idk
Okay
Fuck
Maybe I should do Thursday night
With Jackie
I will see
All guys night first night as well
That was a drunk sentence
All guys except Willa
Fuck
Lololololol
This is killing me
This is almost definitely platonic
Ugh
Yeah
I was never trying
Lol
Shit, do I have a Diamond?
Define trying
Yeah sure
That hasn't changed
Nah
Jk
Better to suffer for want than lack of want
I'm on the right track
This is a good idea
# masochism
Yaaaaaas
Another idea
This is a good way to go through life
If I keep it ambivalent, she will start guessing about me, and then so into guessing she starts guessing about herself, and then tricks herself into liking mw
Good idea
Gonna tell this to Blake as a life lesson
I got rekt tonight
Anyway she just asks me what I do, and how I came to Uber
So this new grill that got transfered to HQ from ops recently came up to me today and wanted to talk
So I ran into her at dinner and was "talk now"?
Thought it was about cleopatra or something since I've done stuff on that before
I said "what"?
And she was like "I have family in Miami yada yada...and my youngest brother is autistic."
Then she asks if she can ask something personal
#rekt
Very peculiar questions
og
been here since 2013
Some launcher who transitioned to research
I don't remember
So I called autism a disease and freaked her out lol
People of autistic siblings and children see it right away with me
Which of course is just be smarter than average and as unautistic as possible
But parsecs ahead of anyone in the autistic community
So always want to know what the secret is
And always want to talk about it
Because I'm wildely successful for anyone my age
But not mean enough to tell them that -- yet
I forgot
I'll ask her soon
Why need to know so badly?
IDK
Can't remember
Don't know task
LOL
Was
She's a kind of hot launcher in South AMerica
Now in SF
LOL
Will task later
LOL I wish
It could have been any grill
Grill is what matters
Why?
Guys don't ask this shit
This is some neurotypical bullshit
JK
Because life happened
Believeable?

True, true. She's pleasing to the eye, but not super hot
Cool
So Jacky has to leave by 8:30pm
Might just come then
So if I get there by 12am, is that good?
Email or text you?
Never emailed me
I actually know what working with koushik is like
Rude
Why though? He already accepted the offer
Cart before the horse etc
So I can see the scenary.
Is drive to Tahoe nice?
Might wanna do tomorrow morning because easier
*lighter
Is get there at 12 okay?
Okay, then just join you guys later tonight
Okay, see you in a few hours

Hey

Scam?

What happened?
How dare???
Lololololol
Lol
In a meeting
Yes
Lol
Getaround
Thoughts?
Putting your car on
Fiona was less boring than most other friends. I liked her. Why didn't Ryan go for her? Good opportunity
Why not?
True. Agreed she likes him?
Lololololol
Lol
She's a chill girl
But might want commitment
Lol
Maybe you were a vertice in a bfs
Oh
I mean she's in college. You're good looking and have a high paying job. Not too unlikely
Dumb af, though. Shu is so much worse
Lololololol
What if broke up for you?
Lol
Well she's not the smartest
Wow
Comments on my hasty over engineering
I don't think ava is happening
We got the place in Hayes valley
$3300/mo
But one month overlap
Idk
Is ava worth an extra $400/mo?
Worse than Hayes valley
So basically
Worse neighborhood
Hayes Valley place is two blocks also
That's negligible
So for $3600/mo, we can get 2bd 1 bath
No, it is $3300
If factor in extra month, it is $3600
Probably like 700-750 sq feet
Something like that
Maybe a bit larger
But yeah
idk then
hmm
http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/5757250597.html
I know
So what think?
The question is just we make enough money to pass it up?
Did you get such a good deal?
Right
Right, so worth an extra 200 then?
Do you get a lounge?
What are the amenities?
Not really
You still pay like 36% of the price
So cancel fitness sf?
How it kitchen?
Large enough?
dishwasher?
Bathrooms are full baths, right?
Koushik found out about Tahoe
lololololol
FB chatted me
IDK
about it
Don't let him know I told you
Confidential
Yeah well it's the last thing
So you worry if this is the way it will be from now on
Now the last event you didn't and gave a reason why.
So maybe you intend on continuing to not invite him
So like you always invited him before
If he found out 3-4 events later about that one event he wasn't invited to, would have been different
Oh, okay.
So anyway,
This is basic psychology
Like it
It's worse that you always invited him before
Fixed ratio enforcement
Coffee
you two just need to have coffeee.
Just saying you need to tell that to Koushik.
That's what I thought
Same reason why TK gets shit for everything that goes wrong at Uber
I mean they do
From TK
LOL
Okay

Dinner?

Nature is amazing here
Just no chance
Beats California by long shot
Wanted my first time to be special
How is this ugly?
It is worse than latam
Lol
Maine beats California
Well super different
Rolling hills
Maine is super lush and green
Dense deciduous forests with lots of Christmas tree conifers mixed in
Colorful prairies
California is dry
Has iconic cliffs
But trees are much taller and wider
Forests aren't as diverse or dense
Maine Green is yellowish red
But grass always golden brown
Lol
Wild blueberry plants
Just shrubs  and doons
Also cool thing is West Coast nothing really grows next to ocean
Trees go right to ocean
But Maine
But ever greens
Oh really
Not Dense canopy
East Coast has sumac
East Coast looks more tropical than cali
Looks tropical
I guess moisture is more important than temperature
Isn't latam also in a drought?
Maybe Brazil will look like socal in 10 years
Well seems to be happening to North America
I saw dryish lawns
Apparently new England is also in a drought
How get Internet on plane for free?

Wait I thought chaima was self sufficient
Yaaas
There was a girl named ava at the party last night
Why?
What?
But chatbot isn't really simcom v2
No one
We don't have any simcom Integration in MVP
Accepted road map with execs is to break into own service soon
Why so pessimistic about my project?
Yeah but chatbot is a moonshot in itself
I haven't worked on production projects for months
No
It's pretty different
Not really
Chabot is through r2d funnel
A special app that guides users to onboard
No
Simcom is about non guided ad hoc onboarding
Simcom isn't guided
Not exactly
For riders, drivers, etc
Also we have road maps to expand into chat as a platform
Right after MVP
Soon we are integrated with vehicle solutions
But execs are putting a shit ton of resources
Surr
No
Yes
5
Dude
We haven't even released MVP yet
Chill
We need to set criteria
We are already exploring hiring ai
Basically senior
Grad school in ml
But why randomly message me on Sunday morning saying service will fail?
It's chat onboarding already
It's not ai
Because it is a bot
But it is a bot
You message it and it responds and does things for you
Fixed responses
Do you even know it looks?
No keyboard
The robot sends you a message and you get a few options to reply with
You say stuff to the bot
Is chatting
But you can't say whatever you want
So now convinced it is a robot?
She gets it
Lol
🐄
Lol
Get card?
Lol
How is Sergei liking?
Buy a pre roll
So what doing?
I know
Tell serge that moral relativism led to the Holocaust
And to get good
To post or not to post?
Lol
It's more just that this is pretty unacceptable
And public shaming might be justified
Now everyone is super sensitive and apologetic about the Holocaust
Like for every Jew like me there are 5 that don't exist because we had no refugee system set up
But they are doing the same thing to Syrians
True. I don't need to comment for him to look like a retard anyway

Kind of annoyed by that
But feel like overall must be higher quality
What is msrp on your fossil?
Mine is $415

🐄
Be like "man, that's a hot girl. Look at her... Oh wait, she sees me looking at her"
How?
You didn't intend to stare at her
Anyway, girlz in SF just look away
Girls in NYC smile back
Agree or disagree?

Hmm
Like I'm fine with jacq bringing her friends and you bringing yours, but core event at this stage should be people I have a personal relationship with
IDK, feel like I might have become friends with parv over this project
But she might want work life separation
Can't tell yet
Yeah we need even ratio
Okay
Okay
Got it
I don't really care. It's not that sentimental, just want to have a crazy time
Might get some senior engineer on referrals

Think of senior engineer at Uber who is on referrals
Evaluated me

Don't say her name in chat
You will when you get it
She joined in 2014
Got promoted last cycle
Last name is Long
Her name

California is beautiful despite it's residents
Chicago is beautiful because of its residencnes
Lololololol
Lol
Hmm
Interesting
It shows up
Even though she isn't mutual friend
Jason respond to hipchat
Yeah sure
But China's national security is built on a lie
The truth and reality threaten the regime
That Taiwan isn't a country
Sure
I get why they'd do this

Bring cow?

We are seeking education about the Super cow

Carl ranted that I should have facilitated lots migration myself
Even though funnel claimed ownership
Can't do it
A bit sick
kk
LOL
Well I'd say that US 1 is actually better than CA 1
https://www.google.com/search?q=us+1+route&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj7tITht_DQAhXkz1QKHWc_DUEQ_AUICSgC&biw=1440&bih=776#tbm=isch&q=us+1+maine+scenery
Well they're different
US 1 is the east version
I'd say CA 1 has more local variance
Straight forests to high cliffs and fog
US 1 at least the north part has much more trees
And rolling hills
And beautiful blueberry meadows
And iconic lighthouses nestled by quaint towns and beautiful minny-bays
Small towns in new england are much more beautiful
Also more variance
Then you get down to real tropics in Florida
So I'd say more lush
More green
More quaint
More beautiful in a conventional way
But not nearly as striking, vast, or humbling as 1
CA 1
Not quite ready
30 mins
10 mims

Set it to UEFI only
Then rebooted from USB
Ran boot repair again

So easy tho
No effort
Lol
Why not?
????
Oh true
Gonna have to take a phone call first
Eh
I don't want ban mi
Guy from quant field of finance
Oh dude
FOMO tho
🐮
FOMO FOMO FOMO
🐮
Wait
Not dressed yet
Yaaas
Nothing
Smoking
Lol
Feel free to come over if you want to
Dude
Pescadaro is where vochelle works
Can't make 4pm
Later
You gonna go for Joanne?
You should do it
Both into cars, Germany,etc
I mean she seemed to like you at least as a friend
And common interests
Eligible bachelorette etc
Yeah okay
You're in
Eh you have car
Just make her come to you lol
Lol just go for it
If you don't like it later back out
Bias towards action
#culturalValues
🐮
🐮
Right
Well you can either come right out and say it
Or make it clear during the date
Pull her seat forward for her, stand whenever she goes to restroom,etc
But yeah, I would just say "would you like to go to dinner"?
Or something like that
Just make it formal
Come over
🐮
You should be driving Joanne
I already ate
No I meant driving in another sense
🐮
🐮
Nah can't
Got date
Wednesday?
Nah
FOMO
Sounds good
Lol
Ask Joanne out yet?
🐮
Fomo
Do it right afterwards
And follow up if no reply in 5 minutes
Wait someone else is there?
Oh you mean I person
Lol
🐮
Hmm
It's a bit weird because already hang out
But definitely wouldn't say "I'd like to take you out to dinner" either
Your approach is probably fine
Yeah
Right
I like to be forward and direct
Fail fast
Etc
Let me take you to dinner
Or something
Lol
Ask her to go steady
Either way, I don't think equality applied to dating
So I try to convey some sense of masculine hierarchy
I'm serious though
Girls don't respect a guy who leaves it up to them
Seems beta
Yeah, and if you ask, you should have a plan
*most
Well I'd say you actually can convey it's a date by just having a place defined in the question
Just like the same sentence you had
With a place tacked to the end
Conveys you want to impress her
Sure that's true
Anyway,I stand by what I said
Shift the subject from her to you
As in you "taking" her there, rather than her meeting you
Ugh
Do I need to watch video for date?
lol
Well IDK yet
haven't met her
I have to meet girl in person before I get feelings
Oh dude
This movie is actually good
??????
🐮
???
Watching moviw
Oh it just ended
I guess sleepson
Fuck she not that hot
Lol how exit?
Just message me
Lol
Oh thanks
Not that bad
Enjoy her company
Just don't wanna date
Coming
10 mins
Ja
now
Yes
Down now
Coming down now
Oh dude
Isn't chaima a singleton?
My physics professor used that to justify the existence of a monopol
A magnet with only one pole
No
He used the argument that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
Yeah?
Bring to chaima to work day when?
Nice
How gonna pop question?
OK
Okay
🐮
Maybe
LOL
about to head home
At home
Okay
In a bit
Lol okay
I come
Nice!!!!!
Maybe
Lol
Nothing you can do now
Have to make it clear during date
Body language?
🐮
I think she realizes it's a date and is maybe playing it cool
Idk
That's why I hate the casual aspect of it
🐮
You going on Friday?
FOMO
Can I come?
Tfti
🐮
Where going?
How does she not use Google anymore?
🐮
Where going?
Rude
Decide right now
Mr tipples
I make Facebook event for you
Invite you and Joann
But don't worry
I respond Not Going
Where?
Where tho?
Fomo
🐮
Heading back soon, but might get a beer with cam
Kk
🐮
Coming
Packing up
No
Home
Come
Is that why you left?
What was so funny?
🐮
Lol is fun to listen to though
Kk
Rudy showed me a link I can download my history on
So probably can go to DMV on Tuesday
If they let me use temp license, should be okay
Goodo
Why texting then?
Lololol
Goodo
Take her home
Damn it
Is she into you?
She's far better than shu
Not as good looking as Fiona
But better personality
Goodo then
🐮
Yes
I mean if don't feel it you don't feel it
Yes so you're saying that you're Doing?
D?
Just don't make her mistake
If you know for sure there is no spark
Make that clear now or a date or two from now
So you can just be normal friends
Well you do
Just be obvious
You know or you don't
If it's not a hell yes then it's a no
But you should think about it in context
Like maybe D wanted official relationship or nothing
You could probably swing something casual with Joann
Seems like she'd be down with it
I think you should try going FWB route
And feel it out
Yeah
I know you don't feel the same way about Joanne as you do about D
But you deserve to have someone after all this time
It's been awhile and I don't think dry periods are beneficial
Just have fun and don't over think it
But don't commit to anything
Come over after if don't take home
🐮
🐮
Do dogs procrastinate?
What happened?
Rude right now
Okay I ask joann
🐮
I send screenshot of conversation
Why?
I'm not at work either

Worked for awhile
Now down to 9/10
I mean I have 9/10 passing
🐮
4.5 hours to get cases 9/10 running
Another 3 for the last one
🐮

Lol

Whoops
Chaima
Chaima
When giving me chaima?
Pls

Who is we?
Oh
I thought you were going to take them with Brendan
Yeah dude
I used to be in a choir
Was a beautiful soprano
But then voice dropped
Now sing out of key
Yeah but is it possible?
You have to breath funny for like an hour a day
That's what Brendan told me at least
That's not what Brendan said
But it would be super sucky for me
Because used to be good
Then voice changed
But wish I could still hit all the notes I wanted to
I don't wanna be soprana
Am tenor
Tenor is fine
But wish was accurate tenor
Like Brendan
Really?
IDK dude
Like girls can move waste so easilty
I can't do that at all
I don't think I could ever learn to move it as well as girls naturally can
LOL do they?
Brendan said it was natural.
Not that bad
LOL
Don't hurt yourself for skiing
No
Absolutely not
Dude
Clara showed my name spelled in Korean
Apparently it works
FOMO
Still?
As opposed to when?

Brae af
Flat tirr
Flat tire
TFTI
JK
Not doing anything
Come by if want
We can smoke
Was just practicing algorithms
This one's a bitch
It's obviously some application of binary search
Well the implication is that you know the median of each array
We know that
We know we can binary search each array
So what do we do with this?
No
Come
Oh no
Just cringe worthy meme
The snap
Whatever
Fomo
Lol is Nadeem back?
Yeah
I was just saying oh God as in its finny
Nevermind
🐮
Just meant meme by the Brett picture
🐮
🐮
Lol my recruiter
Yeah
Do it
Yeah
He's working with me
Why jank?
Lol
Wat
?
I found that farm
Sunday af
🐮
I am sure you are messaging joann
Yeah
the
??
What mean?
Oh true
Chatbot is out
LOL
ugh
So Teza said they like me
But going through reorg
So don't know what headcount goals are
BTW, if Voleon interview goes well, can I list you as reference?
Reference is make or break
If you think I'm a shitty engineer, I won't list you :p
LOL mention me
We talk afterwards
No time
Onsite tomorrow
Eh will come for a bit
Lmk when go
LOL
Nice!
You come
I have sushi
I guess I can come
Nevermind
be there in a few
LOL FOMO
???
LOL
Sorry, did word break I first
I think the test cases for that were wrong
This does sound pretty DP
I'm not sure that it is, though
Like are the subproblems really overlapping?
Kinda just greedy
Yeah just greedy bro
Over and over again
Actually I see it being DP
Yeah
Well that doesn't mean it's not DP
It just doesn't have to be
So DFS is the greedy approach
Just keep combining until you die
Or succeed
If succeed
Then you're good
Yeah
DFS af
DP probably
LOL
The subproblems are overlapping
Not true
If the last two words are the same
Yeah that is leetcode
???
🐮
Well didn't get walked out
And they asked for references at end
In about 30 mins
I'm on my way! Follow my Uber ride: https://trip.uber.com/tdIdMgmpZW
When voleon calls for references
Do not mention our personal relationship
We are strictly coworkers
Best friend implies bias
Thanks dude
Sounds good
Just moo in answering every question
Feel like that right now tbh
Had 1:1 with Stephanie
Got boba
She insisted on paying
Best PM ever
Ashu never paid for boba
???
What?
Yaas
Can I come to dinner?
Show
EDC?
Ok
Almost identical to mine
Except I had teza
And no de shaw
Yeah
So DE Shaw and Two sigma are household names
Very famous and well regarded
But super big
And a bit bureaucratic
Hmm
Well you are given a lot of Independence
At the same time
Ideas do have a process to surface
So not guaranteed as much of an impact
They are old
It is very deliberate
Well I wouldn't say that
But they are very careful in what they try
So most Algo firms are < 100
Yeah
Just get gud
Yeah not a huge deal though
So gate I turned down
Couldn't find anything
Same as hbk
Idk
Not accurate
Idk
Yeah
Idk
So anyway
Yeah absolutely
Data pipeline processing is a huge part of statistical arbitrage
So voleon super smart people
He wants you to choose 4?
I would do gates, voleon, DE Shaw, two Sigma
Probably but ask Jake
Ok
Then maybe hbk
????
So I am back at 4:30
🐮
Driving
Okay
Not smoking first?
How long will you be there for?
Give address
Where?
What doing there?
Ah
Lemme 5 mins in advance
I'm listening to bad comedy
Are we doing dinner after?
Just message me 5 mins in advance
🐮
🐮
Paying
Good but $$$$$$$
$70/person
Ah
Hmmm
lol
Well can't you decide that when you have offers?
Think about it this way: why do they not trust the value of Uber stock?
Either they are trying to fuck you over
Or they are right and $350k a year is better than what you actually have now
Yeah
He definitely does this
Right
Sure
Yeah true
Hmmm
True
There's KCG
Bridgewater
HRT
Yeah I should have done that too
IDK
Probably online
I am
Like $225
In about a week?
LMK when they set up a reference call.
Yeah...
That's not true
Lol
Voleon does statistical arbitrage
So just give recommendations to broker
Hmm yeah
Well I'll see
Yeah definitely
Nah
That's what cocaine is for
Angellist says higher
Idk
Dude I don't care too much
I get offer first
If too low, won't take
Why stress now?
Yeah I just get stressed thinking about it
I'm just not gonna think about this anymore
When I get offer I get ofter
Until then
Already did interview
Yeah I do
Idk
They didn't
Jake said 1-2 weeks
Jake said Chris said they liked me
Eh idk
It was weird
Very into long architecture discussions
Not super algorithmic
But the programming question was algorithmic
Well idk if you discuss those
Like you either are good at architecture or you aren't
It's not something you practice
I mean I was never ranked badly for architecture
So not good use of my time
I already know architecture
People at voleon liked my solutions though
Yeah idk we'll see
I just want to learn lambda calculus right now
It is useful
Super cool
Basis for machibes
You learn it?
No lambda calculus was what spurred creation of type theory
I am doing one thing
Lambda calculus
Nah I take break
🐮
He is here...
He moving in on Tuesday
Idk
Lol just watched get out
Nah didn't hang
Wehanging tomorrow
Eh I had to do errands
🐮
Lol
I realized why salaries so low
That is base
Then guaranteed equity is different
Sorry guaranteed bonus
Idk
Taxes?
Oh that's probably why
So if get fired
Every year
Right
Lol
Well I don't intend on changing my habits too much
Yeah I know you would
Early retirement
🐮
So you would be able to budget for the previous year
So it would take a year
Yaaas
Lol this is some stress right now
God it seems so impossible
How you and Robin always talk about things and analyze them but don't get anxious
Also let
Let's come up with a list of questions for me to ask voleon
1. What are the hours? Super early?
2. Is the guaranteed bonus awarded at the end of the year? prorated?
Sounds good
FOMO
Charlie is bringing his own
Why not?
Oh
Ryan take?
Why not?
I'm not
Sleep is boring
LOLOLOL
No like James and I both have bed
Charlie is bringing in his bed
So have to give up one bed
Idk
Combine the two
Lol I wrote a super good paragraph
No...
As intern I did 16k
Over 3 months
Nah
Less
I coded more than you as an intern
Because just coding
Not other software stuff
I compared myself to full time employees
I committed more often than you
Lol
DE Shaw through Jake?
Ah
Yeah he is a bit manipulative a bit
Well it is good interview practice
Yeah he's gonna flip when I tell him to hold off on Voleon for Jane Street
If I get a voleon
LOL
LOL don't have right now
Just wrote why I like quantantive trading
Why in normal tech business drives algos
But in QT
Algos drive business
And then ranted about how functional programming is the best shit in the worldf
Because as you know Jane Street is an OCaml shop
But IDK if you can get more at Google
Interview there and see
Jake was also condescending a bit this morning
I was like "I want to have a New York option"
And he was like "I don't think you understand the magnitude of what Teza is going through"
And then he explained
And it made sense
But of course I didn't understand...
He didn't tell me...
But like if he explained their situation and I was still pushing for it
Then I'm an idiot
But I didn't know their situation
And this shit isn't public
Also I think like $300k a year is realistically what you'll get
Like $315k maybe
I think the difference between Qt and tech is tech is more collective
Like I know a lot of shitty engineers
That become super rich for joining places at the right time
and plenty of smart engineers that are broke because of bad luck
Whereas in QT it's all about you
If you're shitty
Then you'll get paid pretty little
Also there is revenue sharing involved
So more like year over year
Not based on number of shares
Which is kinda a proxy for revenue sharing but kinda not
It's very finance environment economically
IDK
That's your choice
My advice is you should interview both places
So like interview at Jake's places
And Google and Facebook
And then a startup or two
Then you can make an informed decision
Right
Also leverage won't matter
Also Google caps out
Like you'll probably get a good offer
But then it's pretty capped
Maybe another $200k increase over the next few years
For QT you can increase by like $500-$700k if you kick butt
And retire by like age 30
Well Google has sliding scale
Also Jake said leverage doesn't matter
I've trusted Jake less and less
Like he knows his shit
But we aren't a team
Just the way that he handled Teza
And two sigma
Like he didn't tell me Two Sigma passed
He didn't tell me what was up with Teza
He kind of just let them slide away
And I had to explicitly ask them
Then hit her up
So I feel like he's a bit manipulative.
Maybe he has my best interests in mind
But you can be well-intentioned and manipulative at the same time
Like maybe he's like "Ari doesn't really know this field well so I'm not gonna let him fuck himself over"
Which is something I'm not down for
And that's best case scenario I think
Can you create group chat?
I also need to ask her some questions
About Jane Street interview
Because Voleon attaches aggressive signing bonuses
That I'd forefit if I waited
Chaima
Okay awesome. Thanks so much
Yeah
Def
Python af right now
For negative I'll say maybe needs a few months to learn how to code again
Sure
Just come in
Door is open
??
🐮
??
Okay...
I didn't want pics
🐮
Weed
You coming?
Interview when?
Why taking so long?
Jk
Nowhere
Idk
Idk much
I mean there is kcg
But formed from merger
Bridgewater is standard hedge fund
Citadel is gold standard
But Jake represents them
There's a list on Quora
There's also hrt
But recently not doing well
Oh he didn't?
Citadel has huge turnover
Political
High stress
Embodies some of the negative connotations finance has
🐮
Lol TV shows
Twilight zone
🐮
Taking a shit
No
Coming down in 2 minutes
Time me
I need to give you jacket
Not goin to Costco
Meet back at apt
What doing?
Chaima
Yeah super simple
Can submit as many times as you want
They give you hidden test cases tho
So you get one test case where you get to see input and output
For the other 9 it's hidden
Yeah
They say one thing
They say whether exception or wrong return value
Don't tell you exception or return value tho
Aren't you worried you might be out of practice?
Read the spec
It says it right there
Hmm
Did they remove it?
Oh
Haha
I remember
LOL
What think of problem?
LOL
Ah
Python af
No not how it works
Just test run your code lol
The page
Larry Page
How does it feel to code again?
Do you remember how?
Get brunch?
Ordered
Yaas
What kind of order?
Market order?
Limit order?
Stop order?
LOL
Brunch tomorrow?
And how is problem?
FOMO though
FOMO though
🐮
Don't remember
It says in spec I think
Got you your pen
🐮
Don't remember lol
🐮
Eh kinda like Algo trading
If there's an arbitrage that isn't getting closed
It isn't a sentry error
You can't manually look at inputs and outputs
Because too many
Lol told you to lose linux
I wouldn't know
Lol
Just try your Algo both ways
Try both ways
This is why it took me 6-7 hrs
Yep
Well it might
It might make it work
Yeah
Lol
Lol
I know
Sucks
How mad?
I think it's part of the process
They want to trigger you
Doesn't it say in the spec of which order to execute stop orders in?
Lol
Finish?
Submitted?
Lol
Had dinner with Connie, Serge, Doug, will, nick
Yeah
I'll let you know
Yeah paying now
Serge and Connie are building bed
Come hang?
We help?
Come
Unit 610
Yeah
We chilling
Come
Idk
But was $10 cheaper
FOMO
Why?
I call TPS guy and ask/.
What was your paragraph?
JK not gonna do
What was your paragraph?
Maybe too senior
Like they either want junior guy like me or super senior like Carl.
LOL
Or your paragraph was bad?
Reply and be like "why tho?"
OR
Maybe we both fit the same role
And I got in first
JK they would interview both and then decide.
Likely
I rek you
I just interview at all your places first
And ruin Uber reputation
Oh dude
Were you happy?
LOLOLOLO
Fuck
Pics of face
Is she cute?
Body is excellent
Face is meh
Big boobs + Asian slim
Do it
Oh
LOL
True
She probably will think it's a lord of the rings reference
Or Star Wars
Just say "It's good to bee matched"
🐮
Oh shit
Ya gotta be super composed in your messages.
Oh good shit!
GOod shit
Yeah
Kenan and Scotty will be here
Are they invited?
Oh then they will show up
Yeah I remember now
You told me
But they will show up
Lotnin
LOL
Why did Sasha unfriend?
Is she mad?
Sasha sent paragraphs dude
Entertaining af
A long time ago
Right after halloween
Chatted her up
Agreed to hang out
Then chatted a bit
And she would send paragraphs and paragraphs
Example:
LOL
Paragraphs af
IDK
Just noticed one day
Oh like December 2015
No
I ghosted
Said I'd message her in a few days with a good time
Never did
🐮
Eh met jochelle
Felt weird hanging with her
And just forgot
Idk
Probably the wrong choice
Hmmm
I suggested it
Okay
We need to pick up sandbags
Thank
Is Berkeley a quarter system?
LOL
Ugh
Jason
I don't know what to do with my life
Kinda don
School takes lots of time
But also like courses up so much more possibilities
I feel like won't be able to pass
Also IDK about interesting jobs
Like I know I can get CRUD job
But if want job in ML
Might need more qualifications
Maybe
I do
Like if job is shitty
Like you have to stay at a place for 4 years at some point
By the end of third job
One of your first 3 needs to be 4 years
What recruiters tell me
True
Come up
Angie got promoted
Lol
Wat?
Lol
You had no chance after I interviewed there
🐮
What about Two Sigma?
Or DE Shaw
?
LOL
What did you do wrong?
You literally did exactly what I did
I did
Why?
Classes for limit orders
Override __eq__
And using min and max heaps for limit orders
Oh true
Because Python 3
Hmm
Maybe that's why I got it
No GIL
Global interpretor lock
Huge reason to use Python 3
No GIL means you can do concurrency programming in Python
You think you can but it's an illusion
No you can't
Look at the answer
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36620692/concurrent-in-python-2
Concurrency means you have to have a new python process
That doesn't count
I'm talking threads
Yeah but they aren't concurrent
They are concurrent but not parallel
Like if I have a UI thread in Python
You can't have background threads in Python 2
In Python 2
And and a background thread
It's not a real thread
But you can wrap C for concurrency
The background thread will block the UI thread
Not in Python 3
GIL = one Python instruction at once
Where is this?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock
Only one thread at a time
And long atomic operations take a long time
Yeah
But no hardware acceleration
Yeah like algo trading
So in Java
Two instructions could be vastly different
In performance
But they want to see you implicit make that tradeoff
LOL but they want Python 3
I'm just trolling
Got you and Ryan to have metadiscussion today
I'd have to see submission
Even though they use Python 2
So good
But what did you do wrong?
And safety measures you might not have had
I used enums
That's one thing differently
I also had a lot of helper functins
I did a hell of a lot
🐮
Just reply to email
Yeah wish they had feedback
"why tho"
Fomo
Jason leaving at 2pm?
🐮
🐮
Okay
🐮
Door is open
Are we walking back to ava?
🐮
🐮
Yeah
Did coding challenge yet?
Lol
What new team?
What time?
Be out in 15
Bathroom
Stomach is sick man
Lol
What happened to chaima?
Kenan and scotty are coming on 16fh
Can they come to dim sum?
LOL hmm
Maybe
Did you do A-list challenge yet?
Is this a triangle?
Why not?
What tree?
No edgecases
Only two test cases...
Really?
No...
Wait
You way overengineered it
Uh
Did
Solved in like 15 mins
Oh dude
Not would
Just looped throw rows
Like split array into rows
find_min(row_index, prev_index, prev_sum, rows)
Then made a recursive function
LOL
Because realized that for any index
Yeah
And right = prev_row_index + 1
So at the end I suddenly thought was dp
left = prev_row_index
So then just did a min of the recursive call between the two
Yeah
But I don't think submit changed
But that didn't run
Then challenge ended
Nah
And put a memoise
LOL
Well
I'm worse than you in general
Not luck
That's the thing
That realization isn't luck
But you have to notice properties
They are looking for you to notice patterns and properties of things
Nah
here's what I do
I found the first one a bit difficult though
Well it's a loaded datastructure
I try to be as scrappy as possible
Do not transform something significantly
So I have a rule
Eh the first problem isn't quite a tree
because multiple roots
It wasn't a good tree
Also the tree I used for the first problem was simple
I had no tree class or anything
Because my tree took 30 seconds to build
No but this was the tree
It was literally just a list of indices
{1: [2, 3], 6: [5, 7], 2: [4]}
this is important
Yours probably took 5 mins
Yeah
I coded up brute force solution super quickly
You code as fast as possible
So for like cruise
So that's the key
Because brute force took me about 7-8 mins
But if the right solution was the brute force and I tried to be fancy
Could have spent 20 mins implementing it
And then it failed
So I was like "wow, need to optimize"
But was okay
Which gave me 20 mins to solve it the right way
but no time left
And then would have spent 5 mins trying to make it work
And then realize brute force is only way
But it doesn't allow bad coders in
I thought good practice was "overengineering"
Also keep in mind that the interview process at Uber is obviously not ideal
because we get huge variation in talent for each level
That happened at voleon
Wait at the end of your challenge
Did it say "completed"
Ok
LOL
Yeah
This is
uh
This was just an oversight
The data was already in a pyramid
A lot
But look
Like the data was already in a tree
I think you just lead yourself down a bad path
Probably wasn't even expecting you to try to turn it into a full BST
I don't think was trying to trick
which shouts "tree"
They just wanted to see if you could reason about indexes
Naive solution is arbitrary
Eh
I think they expected you to just try it in-place
Because data was already there
But code ended
I changed code to try to put memoise around it
Wait one question
Okay
LOL
Okay
But like was organized as a tree already
After I submitted
Didn't submit
But time ended
Just halves the constant factor
I mean DP doesn't really help the runtime too much
Hmm
Then let's study elixir together
Maybe if you studied with me
But I studied elixir and it helped me complete this coding challenge
Would have solved
Okay actually Jason
if you want good practice
Apply to Cruise
They have super good questions
Lol the last point
Get more out of hanging out with people
I feel like we are much closer
I view it different
Also I think Uber was super unique in that sense
Like I viewed last year as top of funnel
This is bottom of funnel friends
Sure less variety than Uber
Like I don't think most larger companies will give you that core friend grou
For a company of its size, Uber is the exception
You're more likely to find friends at small companies
But I think that may have been a one time thing
Sometime but we get new friends
Yeah it does if it reaches equilibrium with the rider supply
🐮
Yeah happens
Like brandon
I'd do it with you but...
🐮
He will introduce
Charlie is a good route
We've grown up
Yeah
Lol
🐮
Hence NYC
Ageeet
Yeah
Oh more girls
Also people are more social there
People are all weird here
Friend groups are more contiguous
Tech is a lazy culture
People are less brae
But brae
I told you about the party I went to
But in SF and NYC I meet strangers all the time
But hard to find
But not hard to find in NYC
I meet strangers here all the time
But don't want to
The ones in NYC are much better
In NYC
Not as much here
Could try to be friends
Do they?
Similar randos
In NYC similar friendliness
But random much better
But those people are brae
Yeah sure but opportunity cost
Versus NYC 2 nights
Just an example
Like in SF might have to go out 7 nights a week to find people
So I can take the other 5 nights to learn elixir
Huh?
I do
Just saying I have other priorities too
So SF much harder to find people
I'm down, but can't rn
SF just takes awhile
Also multiplier
I see your point
Neighborhood walks are kinda cool
They are super good ways to meet people
Just talk to people on the walk
Because people are academic yet social
But have to get up earlier on Saturday
Meet in a location and person gives the group a tour
Kk
No I mean these are tours
🐮
http://www.sfcityguides.org/desc.html?tour=34
With kenan and scotty
Okay we go
This takes like an hour
Why tho?
Like I was in a dream state
Well like I felt remote
Like just detached
Removed from my body a bit
Oh not the same as food coma
What is?
Wait what happened to Vera?
Oh shit
🐮
🐮
Just teza
Two sigma when?
Not looking good
?
Yes
Two sigma when
Why not?
After job
Lol contract work is like $100/hr
What time?
kk
Leave yet?
?
Coming
🐮
Here
Where is the doc of safegraph being brae?
They seemed super fun to me
You told me once
You said grill told you
Anyway has been corroborated by others.
🐮
🐮
Notice how they all have to go back to the house, not just one of them
Back now?
🐮
What doing?
After that leavs
No come
Can I talk for 5 mins?
Lol discussing tomorrow kinda pointless
Oh on lsd trip
But whatev
If busy that's fine
Kk
Friends staying until Saturday I think
Idk
I'll get back to you
Tonight
Ugh
The problem?
lol
There's two though
🐮
Let me ask rn
Lol
Nice
Finish?
What night leaving?
Hmm
I'll see
Lol hmm
Kenan and scotty want to go dancing Friday night
Wait dude not confirmed I can come
What time are you atving on Saturday?
Okay didn't realize how important this was
Okay but have I ever ditched an event before?
I get it
Okay
What time atving on Saturday?
I can work with that
Yeah dude you just realized how difficult it is for me
But i can make that work
Can you send me the details of the ATV booking?
I will meet you for ATV I think
What is address for ATV?
Wait i need to come down one sec
Where?
Your apt
Nah
We smoking cubans
Hanging with Kenan and Scotty
Aren't they awesome?
IC you actually use your brain
Yeah
Also not pawn
Oh lol
Just wish these were in NYC
What is blend?
LOL
Not preferable
That's the problem
Yeah true
Then would be fine
If you're just doing roadmap and stuff
And architecture
Would make friendship a little more complicated
I'd trust you as TL
I guess TL works fine
Yeah
If it was just roadmap and architecture
Then was fine
Right exactly
If you can get people onboard with that?
But I'm not going Friday...
Okay lol
Yeah
First need to find car
Then will do.
Yeah
What?
???
Koushik will play?
LOL I know
But you said "play"
Read your original statement
That
🐮
OK
s what I was confused about
🐮
OK
🐮
Jason where is board games?
Oh friends are coming
🐮
$70
Lol Rachel is here rn
🐮
Rachel af
Fomo
Other girl at Tahoe
Regina
The other girl from the other group
"Regina"
🐮
Fomo
Jason
We are going to karoke
My room.
That was last night
Some place in Japan town
Lol
I decided not go lol
Was tired af
Just Korean things
Otherwise no
Teza is on hold
Jason how know about 1-1?
Heroku
Yeah

Yaaas
Principle engineer
Lol
And then can get the connections to point your config file in
But I think is separate service you buy
Lol fuck man
I'm tripping at angel level shit
I don't remember
Or get for free
But this was a couple years agi
And I was coding in node
Which I think they supported first
I think
Node and Ruby were the trendy thing to support in 2008
Now those languages are almost corporate Enterprise
Lsd means infinite fuzz
Everything is just a tangent
Pics
Chaima always on lsd
This is why you can't code on lsd
Chaima
Tripping with chaima
More
Fuzziness will subsume the entire existence of chaima
Is this the reality you want?
Because fur will like become alive and start growing and glowing and shit
Chaima will be irrelevant in context of the fuzz
🐮
Is good
It is always good
I don't have bad trips
When dinner?
Oh dude
Was Raymond party good?
Okay this is so funny
So read above
Is emo Ashland post
And right below is your happy go lucky rooftop chilling
Post
So comical
Lol wat?
Facebook does bridge all social divides
Lol I kinda wanna message her
Lol yuppy life
Hmm
That's what she would say too tbh
Then just see if can redis
It's interesting that companies evaluate each other in terms of each other
You know
Like your worth of being qualified to work at slack
Means how well you can use Heroku
Aws?
I wonder what heroku take home question would be
Anyway it's just a dag of companies
The corporatism has reached a point where it is well suited by a CS data structure
This is the definition of neoliberalism
Fuck dude we are completely different mind states
🐮
Colonialism except not in terms of geopolitics but in orchestration
That's my point
Neoliberalism
But there is a dag
That's the interesting thing about a DAG
Is how it's defined
You don't realize how far outside of the center you are
It's the most cunning data structure
Until it's too late
The center is always a resting place of sorts
Well in this dag
Or any day?
Dag?
Or equilibrium for time being
Can back traverse to another section
A solution
If that equilibrium is then distorted
Well it can be
But that wouldn't be a useful way to construct a DAG
That the outer points in G.arry would satisfy the solution
Then there is no runtime in the computer world
Or profit in the real world
Well edge is profit rather
Right
So your business is problem
So an instance of g is the business ecology in the status quo
Graph G is the parameter
And each edge represents the cost of using a solution or servicing a business
Fuck Jason have you eaten yet?
Also how close to a solution are you?
Lol okay I'm going home when it becomes dark
It's such a beautiful evening
Never use
Is not the best built library
But idk if anything is better
How is it being brae? Give example
Rude
Fuck I just stared at a leaf for 20 mins
I guess I'm one to criticise anyone rn
Jason how long? I am coming soon
Jason where?
Few hours?
I chill now
But might be asleep then?
Dude fuck tho
Need to talk in like an hour
I help find bugs in code
Sounds good
But not before 9:13
Come now
I always help you find bugs
LOL
Interview tomorrow?
Did you give notice yet?
LSD when?
Yeah well you can wake up at like 6am and take it
Is good idea
Why not?
Then you're done by 7pm
Maybe I go on date on Saturday night
Lol
Roobin
Nah
Need to concentrate on interview
Parents
Lol might be in Quebec city then
Lol
Idk
Live in Maine
Not that far
Nah not yet
Where going clubbing?
Fomo
TFTI Jason
Yeah
Lol
But it's a totally different street in that part of the city
Lol yeah there minna is completely gentrified
🐮
Dude I want this week to be over so badly rn
MINNA when?
So not motivated to work
Lol
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
Ah I come in a few mins
🐮
You like modsy?
???
Second choice is Modsy
How did you get free trip?
How did you get it?
And improbable is first
Oh nice
Hit up Sarah
Improbable interview hard af
Yaaas
Did modsy get back to you?
Lol
I don't remember
Lol doesn't matter anymore
Idk I think maybe Jeffrey is senior
But idk
Don't think they have formal levels
I look down on start-ups that assign titles
It is ego based
🐮
Can you Venmo me?
Cool
Fomo tho
Dude she reads Richard Dawkins
$145
Also how was date? This girl is great
Jason what time smoke?
Yeah
Message before coming
🐮
Come
???
Also door is open
Jason
Good tinder?
Be the inductive step of my mathematical function
And yes you did
Jason come
You come
First
rude
Invited
Back when?
Lol sounds good we plan now
LOL where?
?
Come when?
Where r?
Pics of where
He is here
Come now
Jason here
Moo
🐮
Unlimited pto
$600b
Meeting
Free at 1:30
Lolol not sure yet, probably not
10 mins
Ok
Coming now
Okay
3 mins
Fuck 4 mins
Here
When?
But didn't you already drive?
Oh
Haha
Lol
What?
Fomo
Haha in Utah?
Lol could be fun
Hmm
Hidden Markov model AF rn
Lol hmm
Lop
But can't you replace?
Lol
Try a lambo
🐮
Not sold on the jag
Can't you get $100k?
How much is jag?
🐮
Lol what if used?
Ah
Oh lol
Hmm lol how much is your car?
Yeah I mean now
I'd say $35k probably
Hmm I buy?
Lol I want it but don't need it
Lol
Lol maybe will think about it
If moved to socal would purchase in a heart beat
Lol
Lol yeah also gives you warranty
So make the experience good
It's not bad to spend a lot of money on this car
It's bad to spend money when you are just paying for the depreciation
I feel like with a car like that pay for the experience
But this money actually buys real value
Lol just give
Maybe Robin buys
And gives to me
Or dudw
Dude all signs are pointing to me being a used car salesman
Though Jason L says I'm a bad salesman
But rich dude
Like in 2 weeks?
🐮
How about I give you $-35000
Oh dude
Probably gonna be in France
Fuck
What?
So how do I get?
LOL
LOL
How long is interview?
Lol btw trip on Saturday?
Oh dude
Maybe we do Friday then
Oh yes
🐮
https://www.facebook.com/Mooshik-1827955364146357/
During modsy chat ask about technical roadmap
What are the next big engineering products that you intend on developing in Q2/q3?
Yeah
Not feeling it
Eng wise not too complicated
Nothing is emotional
Hmm
Oh lol
I asked each eng what day to day is like
Seemed to have a lot of small optimizations in rendering pipeline
Figuring out how to better render
Right
So I talked to EM about it
They aren't dynamics
Without me asking he said, "We do not want code monkeys who transcript the math into Java or Python. We want engineers to who architect systems given the mathematical structure of the problem"
Like I went to tech talk
The thing is like which architectures (stream aggregation and physical) would best solve the nature of the math problems?
Talked about lagrange multiplierds
It became clear that the lagrange multiplier problem was a map reduce one
*constraint
Also makes most 2 constraint problems 3 constraint ones
Which obviously increases the computational complexity of the problem
Also the exogenic nature of most of the models is a very real constrain
Moreover, this isn't some offline batch job
But moreover introduces a lot of issues of how where the third constraint comes from
The third constraint is usually from the same system at a previous time or an adjacent system
What architecture caters to that?
This is real time
I think modsy would have trouble competing with a problem of this nature
The turnaround time for a request has to be < 3 secs
And the dataset is real time streaming teleometry
Right
So I need to get in writing that I will be contributing to the meat of this problem
Yes and the future of the industry
Yeah
Hmm
Lol yeah I think that's a valid way to think of it
Lol yes but what if can't get?
Rishit says unlikely
What are your thoughts on modsy?
Lol true
FB messenger API is bad though
Doesn't let you pull message logs
Will have to use soleniun
Why like better than modsy
Agree
Don't think modsy has good future
Nothing ground breaking there
I think modsy would be a mistake
What is blend?
Fomo
Ny when?
Fomo
Ny when?
Fomo
Jackie also going to ny
Idk talked to rishit
He said unlikely
What?
I hopefully made the right decision
I know man
Right
Yeah
Yeah exactly
I also had some doubts about modsy
Why?
Yes
Yeah
Exactly
It's not the greedy choice
I don't mean greedy in terms of morally
Than I was not
Than I look again
But this time I'll know I've tried the best teams at Uber
So if life is a greedy problem
Then I was wrong
If it isn't
Right so if it's boring af
I also feel like if I go to a startup
Modsy might not be the best choice
I did the math
The offer was barely equivalent to Uber now
Like I have $4800 per year in credits
So now it is only $8k bump
Free food is easily $2000
And the equity really is paper money
Plus with Uber I got $4600 cash
Lol true
Modsy or blend?
Yeah
Right
Hmm
So I'm also looking at profile of investers
Yeah
The only big name is BBG
So their investers are great
Blend has all the big names
Andreeson Horowitz
Modsy has no big name investers
Which is B-list
peter thiel
Haha
Hmmm
Jason NYC when?
FOMO
RN
Cows af
Oh dude
Jason
Jason
Jason
Jason
Chaima when?
Do you need a chaima sitter?
Wait really?
Then what about NYC?
Still gonna go
Haha
And interview for fun
Interview on Tuesday, right?
Haha
Troll
For a day of interviewing
I think interviewing for the sake of interviewing is worth it
Like these quant funds ask super interesting problems
There are blacklists
I wouldn't do that
I'm gonna go to France
Lol
Wanna come?
Yeah
Lol when?
I was thinking both
Or Spain
Hmmm
Idk
Might wanna go to France and chill with ludo
What if don't need 2 weeks
Lol
How ride?
Rudr
I'm literally being the least rude
Either way we overlap
I'm optimizing for 2 friends
Ugh
Shanna emailed me
LOL
Hmmm
LOL
Social anxiety though
LOL true
Why call?
Fomo
So wait what event do you guys keep talking about?
Emily Brandon?
Lol modsy call was hilarious af
She was like "yeah call us in 6 months and we'd love to have you"
Juan was obviously bluffing
I was like Juan what if call you in 6 months
That was last night
He was like "I don't think so, Ari. You went back on your word and your word means a lot. You can have the next hour to decide but i hope you honor your word."
I replied to email with a time to call
Today shanna calls up and is like "it's all good. Don't worry. Call us next weekend or 6 months and we'd love to have you"
He was Juan like
Like not mad
Just like "I'm disappointed in you. You fucked up" voice
Yeah exactly
Yeah that's what I did
It was just funny to see the contrast between Shanna and Juan
Like Juan wasn't like shouting over the phone
He was cool and well spoken
Like "sad"
You know
I don't think so
Lol he'll have cooled off after 6 months
What do you mean oh well
It was good
Shanna said I can join anytime
Yeah I do
Yeah exactly it is a point against me
I think he was bluffing to an extent
But the point is the opportunity is still there
Haha
Lol no for both questions
Lol hanging with flo now
House
Lol staying in Manhattan
Are you?
Lol no
Why would I get piped?
What?
Dude what do tonight?
Lol invite Sarah
She is kinda odd
Or not
But good sarcasm
Lol I'm sure he'd love it
Lol pics
Salmon lox
Pics
Buy
Go to met today
And Central Park zoo
And check out ny transit museum in Brooklyn
Cool af
So much better than west coast
Fun af
How they built the subways
I know
And the subways beat them all
They are like still a viable alternative to Uber
Rude
Life is amazing
Dude why yell?
Gonna go travel France with flo and his gf
And maybe chill with my dad's goddaughter
Why no what?
One conversation at a time
In New York
Lol
Bad
Okay we skip second conversation
I am going to Spain probably in the middle of second week
Unless you haven't booked
Dates pls
And I'm sure you haven't
Flo and his GF are gonna go there too
The airline?
Ryant or something?
Thanks
What are you doing in New York for the day? It's almost over for you already
With competing brands and niches
Very Jason rn
Oh so it turns out Maddy Wallace was in fashion
High school friend in NYC
And it makes 0 sense
Let me start over
High school is in NYC doing modelling
Wait i reread what I just sent to you
Weird place in life I guess
Thinks the freelancing while finding niche is the way to go
Lol pics of life rn
Hmmm jialu doesn't talk much
It's difficult to get anything out of her
Do you know her?
Yo basic question
You can't iteratively solve an np hard problem
Right?
That would be stupid if you could
Right hmm
I see what you're saying
Just while loops
But no for loops
Too long
Right but how do you know end of problem?
You tricked me
Derp
Hmm
Wait no
Dynamic programming is an polynomial algorithm
Wait for rod cutting it is
Dude I'm having trouble with this
Like for loops are bounded with the size of the input
Or some multiple
So in your loop invariant cause
Do you say i < k^n?
Nested loops scream polynomial
Knapsack dp is polynomial
Dude there is no non recursive solution that uses for loops
And I'm also not finding any examples of a np hard problem being dp and not polynomial because of it
When done using dp
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-5-edit-distance/
Thanks dude
Also polynomial
Oh
That changes everything
But now that we are on the topic
I don't think a dp Algo being np is a thing
Exactly
Dude I was so confused
Also being on acid this was really bad
That's molly
Nah
But dude
Let's revisit my last statement
I was right about everything
1. For loops are only polynomial
2. Dp is polynomial
3. Np algos can't be done without recursion
Lol how?
Yes
For a polynomial algorithm
Lol
Dude
You're the one on acid
From reading this chat
Lol
This is so dumb rn
Literally give me an iterative dfs algo
Okay Jason
Pics
Oh cool
Which borough?
I'm getting lukewarm signals
Wasn't too into her to begin with
So I think I'm gonna stop contacting
BTW didn't hang out this weekend
Lol
What think though? I think not positive
Lol wat
Why so angry?
Okay
You can have
🐮
Fomo
How is interview?
Depends on whether you get front desk or back desk
🐮
Isk
Wow good shit
Hmm might get harder after lunch
Idk
Front desk is working directly with data scientist researchers to productionize their algos
Back desk is like infra and tooling
And the difference in pay reflects that
But back desk still gets paid plenty
Needless to say, front desk is where the best devs are
Not necessarily
Like infra is setting up the Kafka pipeline infrastructure
But designing the topology of the pipelines? That's front desk
Yeah they usually ask question that is easy to solve at first and then throw on additional constraints
Also wanna drop acid on sat?
Oh dude
Go on Sunday
Nah sat night at like 10:20pm
So gotta be at airport at like 8:20
I'm back on 5/6
LOL 2 weeks
SD
Dude just go on Sunday though
Flying? Lazy af
it costs like $30 to fly from Paris to Barcelona
LOL what gonna do with BMW?
Nah
No use for it
I'm gonna get a motorcycle
But is not worth
I know is fun
It's not autistic at all.
🐮
Dude Jason you'll love acid though
Why?
I fucking had a conversation with a tree
That's like the opposite of autism
So social can talk to plants
Why?
Also how are you not interviewing right now?
Oh true
They are probably talking about your performance
And evaluating whether to keep you around for the afternoon
LOL
Do you like them?
You like NYC
Gonna brae on Blend?
#asian
LOL
You like Two Sigma
??
Yeah it's easy to tech > quant finance
lol
hmm
Other way around is harder
Wow
Hmm
That does sound cool.
Andrew Ng is coursera, right?
Oh interesting
Old stone buildings
No smartphones
NYC is super formal though
And old-fashioned
Suites everywhere
etc
Are you doing punchcard interviews?
How wounded though?
Ah makes sense
🐮
Nah
How did interview go?
Done yet? And when flying back
LOL haha
LOL
Are they hard?
Wait why not know how many left?
LOL they don't give a schedule?
Oh lol
It's almost 4pm
They interview until 6pm?
LOL
Lol wow
So there is a Max of 2 more?
Lol wow
No I think it was Doug
Lol it was at the party
Oh god
???
Yes
I'll tell you later
Doing sensory deprivation now
You just ask if they have headcount
Lol
Anything on pricing seems interesting
I'm feeling realtime right now
So Calvin or dispatch
I am in France 4/22-5/6
France
Just book your flight right after SD
Wow air is like $550 one week from today
Spain?
I'm only there for 2 weeks bro
I kinda want to explore all of Paris and France in detail
LOL
LOL
LOL why not? Museums, French art, and I'm gonna go visit Spain probably
Flying between Paris and Barcelona is so cheap
Like $30 round trip
lol okay
lol
Not sure I'm going to Spain yet
Flo and his GF are gonna be in Paris
LOL really?
Hmm
End of tomorrow
I'll let you know by EOT
I see. I'm the opposite
I enjoy social time
But not to much of it
Yeah so the nice restaurant part will be with Flo and his GF
I have family friends in France + Flo
LOL yeah that's why is fun to meet people
So that's part of it
That's a good point
Not on driver
Eh nah I'd rather work at a dedicated place
No
I can't stand the leadership there
If I do doc processing, I do it somewhere that pays me well
I only stayed at Uber because it had a unique problem I had a chance to solve
I stayed at Uber for a few specific teams
I will make Taz take as long as it takes for me to find a team I like
It's that Uber has problems
No
And low pay and objectionable culture
Those problems are only overcome by the unique problem it is trying to solve
But I need to work on those teams
If new company has good pay and technically interesting work, I don't care
🐮
🐮
lol
Oh nice! You bought?
🐮
??
https://reboot.floathelm.com
Get appointment
Im doing Friday at 5:30pm
Try it now. Im sure you can snag a slot
Yeah
Gonna do?
Wow
🐮
#sunset
MaChaim?
LOL then this Saturday...
Sounds good
Hadeyyat might be coming
Where it was very intellectual
Yeah
Not because he didn't want to do it again
Yeah
I'll be the trip sitter
LOL might be too many. Libbey said he wanted to wait awhile
But he had a similar reaction to me
So wants to catalogue
Write down...
I don't want 4 people
You are right that it is an autistic drug
You don't want too many people around
IDK I think might be wanting to spend more time processing
Where I have ideas that I desparately need to share and validate
LOL well you might for awhile
Like I go in between phases
I deeply go between
And then get sucked in for like an hour watching some pattern
But also with a large group navigating the social dynamic is hard to impossible
It's like molly in the sense that it comes in bursts
So during a burst you are just staring at all these patters and colors
But in between those might want to talk about it a lot
So it's not like anti-social in that sense
???
You need to be with people you don't mind embarassing yourself with
I see, it has a lot of similarities to weed because both hallugenigens
It starts and ends feeling like you are getting high
But is easier to concentrate and be lucid
It
Because perception of time means nothing
It's never like you're stumbling around
Yeah
But you cannot jaywalk
??
Ah
But doesn't mean you're down to do things
Definitely is a stimulant
Because you expend a lot of energy staring at a leaf
You'll spend hours standing or sitting staring at a tree
Yeah
LOL
You won't wanna go dancing
Oh dude coming back from France
Might not want to go to Vegas
In event description can I change it to clarify that you are the one leaving?
Since I am cohost
Invited some cool people
I won't invite anymore
Call when here
Where?
ETA?
True
Hackathon
Where?
I'm on 5th with Aldrich
The hackathon isn't anywhere
With Jason
Okay
Ring bell
Yeah
In Iceland
Layover
🐮
Please read up on lambda calculus before hand
Okay, we trip on 5/20
I'll make sure we do automata theory
Lol it's autistic af
Just a tiny bit
Not saying read too much
I need your opinion on some stuff
Right, well not necessarily true
I guess no need to preempt first time
This is for my personal interest
Okay can I teach you quick basics like For 5 mins before?
Right but need to know what you think about lambda calculus
Ah well hard to focus on numbers sometimes
Also don't want to have to distract you during trip
I mean I guess I can explain the basic concept in the car ride there
Takes 2 mins
Flo idj
Gg park
Fuck
I have to remove some of the people you invited
Lol no just not crazy about all of them
I like Calvin
Only two I uninvited were toshi and jacq
No she didn't invite me to her party
I could have gone to dinner
Her birthday party
Hmm I think about it
Right but this event is special for me
I feel like it won't affect our terms?
It feels awkward when they invite some of my friends but not all
To her bd
It's not different
True it feels awkward to me
So this is my party
Lol I'm just annoyed by it
Brae
We frequently go to events together
That day I bought LSD
Like 3 weeks
Why would she not invite me?
From the dealer
That was a few weekends ago
Oh right
You mentioned it then
Her BD?
Oh lol
Just the same thing like I wouldn't particularly want to invite her to this event
So I don't invite
I feel like we were closer as friends than this
But affirms we aren't
Don't have resentment
Exactly
Yes
I don't want to invite her after she doesn't invite me
It feels like I'm less valuable than her
Yeah
Koushik abandoned the friend group
I always come for dinner
Well if we were as good friends as I thought she would have communicated that
Ah
But we hang out semi frequently
But Michelle doesn't seem disingenuous
It's okay to brag about money that you earned
A bit
Old money af
Always a bit entitled and holier than thou
That's all I had
Not at all
When I was in college
I spent $500/semester
Wealth inherently discriminates
But I don't have to reinforce the notion that kids like that grow up with no consequences
Nothing is free
There are good things and bad things
My rotten family history proves that nothing good comes with hand me down wealth
No I'm saying her behavior of picking and choosing resembles that of a wealthy person
I value loyalty highly
I'm not
Who else am I excluding?
Oh I don't think he likes me
I always feel like he's judging me
Sure but that means I'm not in that area despite having known her for that long of a time
So I'd rather not hang out with her either if that's where we stand
These other people there is a possibility of being closer friends
No
Jacques not my manager
I'm not gonna work for her friendship
Right but I don't want to pursue it any farther
With her there is not
If not hanging with Robin, would prefer not to hang out with her
One person I don't want to waste my time with her
But I feel a bit resentment that it didn't happen with her
Why?
So maybe it's not a good match
But she chose to emphasize it
So I don't want to bother with anymore
Yeah
Friendship is appreciating people for their personality attributed over personality flaws
That's the point of a match
There's a fine line between personality flaws
And things you wouldn't want to change
Which ones?
That's fair
I still think there's a point in talking to someone about that
If you value the friendship enough
I've never gotten kicked out of an event
Much less not arrested
Either way she can confront me if she enjoys her friendship
But I find her boring and not worth working for
Because I don't care about being friends with her
If I did I would confront her
I did but she never replied dude
I've given u
She's not worth my time
She's not interesting
I've never had a good conversation with her
I tried to engage her but she never responded
Up
I don't need to go chasing after people I resent
I've found friends I actually like
Okay just checking
Also are you saying Robin does think of me as a friend?
And Jason
And flo and ludo
Also occasionally had and Shriya
So I have you Ryan robin Jackie (though that might be tentative)
It feels weird for me
Also Serge and Connie
That's kind of enough
But I would prefer to avoid it
Everyone else I invited I want to be closer to
If we weren't already
Okay that's my new resolution is to be more accountable
I think it stems from ADHD and not valuing other people's time
If I can fix one of those then the problem is solved
Not much
Like $1k
Hmmm
That matters
How much?
How long?
I'd pay $1k, $5k, $10k
Okay third one is pretty amazing
Maybe $15-20k
Lol it would redefine how I saw everything. I wonder why buzz became an alcoholic
Not feeling it tbh
So it's those finned Cadillacs that get me going
Nothing against this company
But I don't like Porsches
I care about cares for aesthetics
That's so weird
And why TF are they making SUVs?
What about getting it in and out?
Good shit
What if they park?
Lol wat?
Oh interesting
What rate?
$60?
Haggling
Jk
This is cultural counterproductive
I'll shop around and see
Jj
🐮
True
Awesome
That's true
$70
Okay
I just have to see that it works now lol
$4k
Maybe Sunday?
I buy bike hmm
Used
Idk
Mooshik says no sport touring
Too heavy
Max recommended sfmoto
He recommended cafe cruiser
He said they are honest used dealer
Apparently like a smaller cruiser
Much lighter
Ah
This motorcycle shop has a warranty
But the percentage will be a couple hundred
Well look at it this way
Of course it's gonna be more expensive
Reading rn
Hmmm
You still at work?
Lol
Ninja 300 is good
Oh dude
Oh dude
What time does badge expire?
What was it like?
Oh
Also
I can't come to stargazing
How would we all go anyway?
Just wait for next weekend
Motorcycle class
Your car has no capacity
And I can take someone on my bike
Do you have separate garage opener?
Lol it might be
Civic center is $80/month
Yeah
2 blocks
Idk
Where is this?
Metaphorically too
🐮
Interesting
A lot of these issues would be null for me
Would probably want to replace everything besides the frame tbh
Since I'd replace the engine, the fuel would not be an issue
And tail lights, etc
What if we combined tripping with a camping trip?
How eat so much?
Wtf
So dude
When selling bmw?
Dude camping af
Ever been to moonich?
Lol Paris I think is like a bigger Munich
Oh I thought that was Berlin
I thought Munich was that
That's where Schuman lived
Ah sometimes happens in Paris
Ah but dude Parisian girls
People here are super friendly
I've joined tables with strangers plenty of times
Also was a cat in the bar
People here are fun
Ah
Ah people here are more refined about it
But not fratyy
I think people think that refined means not friendly or super confined by etiquette
Is Paris racist or misogynistic?
Paris is similar but more like lsts share wine
Or synchronized
Should have invited you
Also agree that traveling alone is brae af
Also I think you would have enjoyed
Europeans are super nice and friendly
But I think a bit inselar
Cuba I hated tbh
So like the amenities were cool. But everything was cheesy
Paris was like a place I can live
Like people weren't real
Cuba is either poor AF or fake af
But like Paris is inspiring
True
Oh shit dude
Next Thursday
Gf
He wouldn't give
Hanging out with him and his gd
He's willing to introduce
Or else would be awkward af
If I was like " so how long have you been dating?"
So I'd expect they were
No
What?
She is software engineer in linguistics
Linguistics can probably be represented by HOL
That's all I know bro
We hanging at ava
Koush says he might be interested in rejoining
I don't care cause I'll find out
I'll hang out at first and then ask if we should invite you
I'll probably wanna get fairly high and catch up
Charlie won't be there
Lol yeah
He more likely to say yes if high
Lol but have to invite you after
Then invite
Roobin
Neither does toshi
Yeah but he doesn't like me
Australia
Still annoyed
Because of Tahoe
Yeah dude
My life is falling apart
I'm still saying you might have been right
Annoyed = dislike
Not sure Uber is
I'm taking that into consideration
But I think modsy wasn't a good option
Yeah
It was more like modsy is not a good option
Check it out
So I can use modsy as leverage to get a food team
It wasn't so much Uber is a good option
And then if not get a role at a stable company at a good team
Lol
Or part time?
Lol hmm
Like how? Just drop out and spend a few years at uni?
I've been considering that for awhile
Hmm
Might take awhile
Yeah
Depends on how many of my credits Berkeley would take
Which one?
It's a gamble
No I mean I'm still in middle of undergraduate
Lol wat
How find?
Hanifi recommended cool company
Machine zone also is cool

Basically
Also is Connie mad because of argument?
Connie rejected bd party
Rude af
🐮
🐮
🐮
Moo
Bored rn
Come entertain
Dude get girlfriend when?
Girlfriend when?
Home
Like home in Paris
No
Girlfriend when?
Koush has
Girlfriend
Is better at getting girls than we
I know
But dude
Like pics of your girlfriend
??
We go on panoramic or 84 or smth and photograph each other
Wanna go for a photoshoot after I get my bike?
Even better
Yaaaas
I'm thinking 5/20?
Let me think about it
Hmmm
🐮
Uncertainty freaks me out when I trip
I don't have my new team or motorcycle license or anything
State of mind
It's interesting because it's like a fractal
Things diverge visually
And your thoughts do that
Dude I learned this the hard way
So you start thinking in exploding possibilities
I'll let you know on Saturday night
Where?
Oh cool!
Lol how close?
I just blended in and joined them
Btw was a bunch of college students getting a lecture at the museum from exhibit to exhibit
Started asking the Prof questions and stuff
Yeah
Nyu
Museum of modern art and catacomes
6pm
Just eating dinner with dad's friend
What was offer?
Oh hmm
Like $200k?
So blend total comp is much higher as is
Wow Jake lied
Objectively speaking Blend is better for every aspect
And will most likely multiply
By about $30k per year
Right
Right and two sigma would probably throw fat bonuses at you and retainers
Traditional af
Yeah
But then you can retire and do anything you want
But you can make that much in that time if blend does well
Yeah exactly
Go on historical walk
Meet up with Bai Rui on one
She'll tell you incorrect statistics
And then you can talk to her hand
Btw
Do u think dating her would have been good experience?
🐮
You could go drive to your old high school and brag to students from within your car that teachers there told you you'd never amount to something
Lol so random
But sure
Well fuck
We have no mutual friends
How does she know?
No
I did not
No
Lol
Oh because I'm still in Paris
Lol how'd she find out?
We discuss at party
Hmmm
Need to rest on Sunday
And read motorcycle handbook
Sounds good
Down
And research prospective teams
Probably not then
Okay true
But like if things come up you wanna do
Goodminton
No wait
Yaaas
🐮
Here
But pooping
Okay come now
We go to my place
Wat???
Oh I did
More food
Okay

No
It was great
Different guy
Never got contact info
Yeah
Lol but let's not talk about over fb messenger
Hanging with Emilee
LOL
A friend
She works on U4B
We were interns
lol
mooo
What doing?
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-565909/Pictured-The-giant-6ft-cow-big-small-elephant.html
Class tonight
Reading MTC handbook
Driver structural pricing
I really like DSP
Hopefully almost done
Incentives
So like structurally how do we use different mixes of incentives across various hexters targetted towards various auto-cohorts of drivers automatically on a day to day basis?
How do we use exogenous statistical methods to evaluate casual relationships for CPIT?
Works somewhat closely with Calvin's team
Calvin's team is all about stochastic modeling
Lots of markov models
DSP takes an empirical approach using more classic ML and stastical methods
Another is looking into genetic algorithms for auto-cohorting
But one person on their team is using an HMM for something
🐮
well you gotta start somewhere
I don't like using superlatives
This isn't ML so to speak
The top of the industry research is from the datascientists
Generalize the models
Optimize for distributed systems
To orchestrate the pipelines
Right my job is to apply it to a distributed systems sense
The DS team is very competitive
🐮
7pm
Goodminton
Koushik flaked
Badminton when?
Ugh
Leaning more and more to the Jason is right camp.
DSP said no
Yeah but considering I chose to stay at Uber I'd expect an exception
"Timing. Wanted more seniors..."
So it would encourage her to at least retain me
Apparently Stephanie and Ashu gave a glowing review of me to Taz
IDK if I'm inclined to believe him though
Also what pissed me off is that these teams indicated they had headcount before I turned modsy down
KR said she can escalate to Thuan to get me my dream team
And then afterwards were like "wait...nevermind."
Maybe it is
it could be
*not wanted
I wish they would have said they wanted me before.
Hmmm
What think about MichaelAngelo?
Yeah
Yeah
More like tools for ML
Doesn't seem the best
Not ML itself
Bike riding thing
Bike to work day or something
So done
Met this cool girl named Jenny
One of James' friends
We gonna go to symphony together
??
Depends on outcome of this week.
Geospatial forecasting
Forecasting
FOMOMOMOMOMOMO
Over the top
What time?
FOMOMOMOMOMOMOMOMO
Yeah
K
🐮
How early?
Can't do Saturday
Gotta get up early for motorcycle class on Sunday
Like I can get dinner or something
Need to go-to bed by like 9pm?
But that's it
???
Quit where?
Quit what?
What???
Lol
So brae
True
Oh dude
Actually idk
Maybe they are sharing the range
Maximum daylight
Probably designed for winter
6:30am
Hmmm I'm actually starting to enjoy small talk
What is happening?
Fomo
Hmm
🐮
🐮
And then also with Jenny
Just with one manager
Forecasting
I wish I knew
Yeah talking again
I wish I knew
Io stuff
I will
🐮
FOMO
Emilee lost her ID
Looking with her
Yes
Fomo
Done
Get dinner?
Okay
What is nojo?
Soon
Roobin
Who?
Meeting with Koush tonight
No
6:30pm
Yaas
👎
Later
At talk
Liang was wrong
So if you have something more generic
Just not for the weird geospatial hexter model forecasting uses
Sorry model serving
Michaelangelo also does model fitting
It also does realtime serving
Like a gradient boosted decision tree or a regression
Wants to be entrepreneur but no concrete ideas
Not very interesting
Hmmm
Yeah
Wants to break into tech and shows some interest but not much hustle or drive
Was like "I've done Android dev" but had no idea how to do it
I guess maybe drive
But he has no interesting ideas
Just wasn't an enjoyable conversation
Yeah
Like no negatives
Or key talents in the industry
I'd grab a beer with him
But wouldn't want to become good friends or work with him
Not interesting
:p
Waste of time meeting him
Would have rather worked
My conversation was less than decent
ADHD?
Hmm
I think maybe force yourself to summarize each paragraph?
Take notes while reading
Etc
Or just boring stuff?
Is this interesting stuff
Is this blend documentation?
Oh so like bad textbooks
Ask Albert how do read
Would enjoy
Ah so if it was written differently
Lol finance is boring af
Cs textbooks do such a good job
Yeah I don't get why so hard to just write things well
It devoted one sentence to the fixed point combinayor
And then just gets super dry
It starts off pretty fun
That one gets worse
Yeah the algos book does that
Like starts with an example
Then introduces new concept
Shows how trying to apply what you intuitively think works out wrong
Shows how it fixes problem
Why can't they do the same with mortgages? I feel like the same structure would work well
Different authors
🐮
Koushik is still not here
And isn't picking up calls
Omg
1.5 hours late
I say coming
Even I'm not bad
So brae
Beer?
No
Still MIA
Haha
Wtf
Maybe
Nah
Said something personal came up
Yeah
Said couldn't respond because it was sudden
No
Said he'd do it next time we hung
Suzuki gs500f
Parked at 888 O'Farrell
No
Best I could do
Civic center is not 24/7
🐮
How is Blend?
Are problems interesting? Are people smart?
Like Uber 2015?
?
🐮
Lol wat
Lol
MichaelAngelo
Why frown face?
Lots of distributed systems stuff
Need to find out more info
But might be more valuable in the long-term
Not as surface-exciting as marketplace though :(
So could be useful to learn
?
Because I want interesting shit
Not true
Want to be learning something new every day
What did you learn?
But lots of places they were like "you're just being too autistic, let's just #shipit"
I care about architecture and distributed systems
I don't care enough about that
I don
No one appreciated (or really understood) the underlying architecture of how the systems worked
I've talked to a lot of Google engineers who don't know anything about architecture though
Wanna work with people like this guy: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-chen-a645402b/
So then who?
Right but MichaelAngelo is pretty deep stuff
Because you are eng II
I'm not claiming it's industry leadubg
MichaelAngelo isn't specifically ML
It's just a lot of distributed data processing
How use HDFS? Hive? Spark? Piper?
How build timeseries in map reduce without sorting?
How partition data
Like work there for a few months
Then quit
If don't get promoted and don't feel like learning a fuck ton
Yeah
So can afford mentorship
Well team is all eng ii or higher
If they say no, then I sit Taz down and tell her to fix it
Yandong
Give talks
Is meetup
Idk
Idk Jenny shared event with me
Going to ignite SF
Jenny convinced me to try
It's 7pm-10pm
Super skeptical though
Any topic is interesting if the person discussing it knows their shit
Yeah exactly
Do I like?
Also we trip on Saturday
Busy
^ for that reason
Invite ankush?
Indeed.
Either ankush or Jason
I don't have enough
🐮
🐮
Hmmm decide by tomorrow
Not sure if ready to interview
Yeah
Would I like blend though?
Out of practice
Hmm
How about come for dinner first?
Your salary definitely makes me interested
We discuss
Come hang with me and Libby tonight
Oh okay
Wait how long?
Just join later if want to
Fine group chat
No idea
6-7pm
Hmmmm
Sushi?
https://www.linkedin.com/in/neocalvinist/
Fuck feeling down
Need to feel better if we trip tomorrow
Help
What time?
LOL sounds good
👍
Shit just saw this
Just call me (not message) when heading for MUNI
What time coming then?
Okay be down at 3:55pm
Where?
Pics
I eat cereal
Ok
We take and then immediately Uber to park
When coming back?
Oh just want bored
I also like it less and less each time
First time I needed it because I needed to snap out of my mindset
Want to debrief on LSD too
Second time also good
Now I kinda hate it
After that, got worse and worse
Anxiety af
Same reason you didn't like
Yeah it was a bit less potent than I remembered
Yeah hmm
You also didn't necessarily want to discuss abstract ideas. If you did, it might have...but I remember the first time I took it it was a lot stronger
Yeah that was weird
I also didn't feel that this time
Might have degraded over time
Anyway, I'm over it for now
Idk
You didn't get any delusions, did you?
It was not that potent
Lol
Hmmm
The mosquito one
Also maybe you just have good tolerance
You had one delusions
You lied down and we told you mosquitoes would crawl all over you
I could have tried tell you delusions
Yeah hmm okay
Yeah so the problem is you have very good thought control
Such as the tree was talking to you
Or it would open up and swallow you
Or it was a simulation and the cracks were the bits of code constantly being rendered and the swirl fractals were recursion stacks
Idk if would have worked tho
Point is I could give you more acid
Take two tabs
Would be more profound
Hmm that's strange
But what about the restaurant
But also much more freaky at times
Yeah hmm yeah also felt weak to me
You're cup of tea. I'm done for now
Yeah I can guarantee it could be much stronger if you wanted. But you'll also freak out a bit more
Yeah that's more pleasant
Lol nice
Let me know when home
Yeah
I tell in person
Too complicated for fb messenger
Still doing star gazing?
Lol okay
And has a clutch
Except turn instead of press for acceleration
Driving a motorcycle is basically the same as an atv
Oh true
But that's because it doesn't lean
You are never really going fast enough for that
Na
Talked to Taz about promo
But EQ was below
She said technical skills were easily eng II
Said she would promote if I wanted to stay on driver
So she was like "if you join new team, you might not be technically outperforming either because no domain knowledge"
So she was like promoting will be risky
Right
Because need it for motivation
I don't think it takes too long too ramp up
Hmmm I can tell Taz title > comp
I don
I found an outstanding bug 2-3 months old by Thursday, after I joined Monday
So I'm confident that I can quickly ramp up to any service
And I only really started on Tuesday
I ramped up at Uber in like 1-2 weeks
To leave Uber I'd want a bit more than $125k though
Because less equity
I also anecdotally know $140k is possible
Uber would give decent refresher
Like much less equity
Much more risk
But you are saying join for similar offer
Modsy didn't really add up
They gave me $65k
Modsy had no reputable backers
But stastically it's never Uber
True
I see
?
It's backers?
The real question is how do you know what a good company is at that point
Hmmm
Right
I could always try Helix
That was the sudoku verifier guy
I have a guaranteed onsite
But people didn't seem the smartest there
It was so dumb
But like think about it
Modsy gave me $125k
They gave you $135k
Blend gave you $40k
So like if Blend gave me half of an increase
Already $145k
How does it work?
Hmmm
Idk
So I guess hmm then
Gonna do Coursera ML course after shit stabilizes
Okay
🐮
Idk where napa is supposed to be
I sent you that one
Okay
How many people?
We look then
Dude
# of people changes everything
Going to bed soon
Okay
Hmm
Accidentally went on freeway
Idk
Might be a little weird at this point
Idk how with grill I like in front of friends
Like bed distribution?
But if diff bed then friend zone
Dude hwy 1 is so much fun
Hmm. I think about it in ride back up
Hmm yeah but might friend zone
Accidentally
Don't trust myself
Yeah
Like Stephanie?
Ludo?
Hmm
Oh
Flo?
Who?
But u said no to her?
Stephanie is such a guy?
Oh
Make me cohost
Lol
Also inviting Shriya
Clara?
Lol
https://www.facebook.com/snevatia
Lol remember weird party
That was her party
And guy that wanted to hookup?
With Lucy
Why is Willa can't go?
Stephanie has a car
Yeah
How there's two genders
It's kind of weird to think about
No we have 1:1 today
But have some anatomical differences
Like half of the people are relatively the same
Hmmm okay
Let's talk with mod
I'm definitely very open to Blend
Dude I'm actually super angry about yesterday
Taz literally said a month ago that switching wouldn't affect my promotion
LOL I meant do mod
I don
Because she
Because she's senior eng manager? Super influential
That should be enough
Point is I'm putting in good work
Switching teams is simply political
How do they think?
And I just didn't think she would lie like that
It seems like an antisocial job
But maybe I like people TOO much
I thought I didn't want to become a manager because I didn't like people enough
But it's her call
It's not like she looked into it
She changed her mind...
Is it not? She said it was her decision
She'd have to think about it...
You don't make false promises though
You don
Also just why set expectations poorly? Again, the job is antisocial
How can she say I don't have good conflict resolution? What did anyone on the team ever do?
I also helped resolve a number of conflicts and help resolve the team mission
LOL okay
Right but she didn't have to be transparent
If she was she would have told me from the get go if I stayed and transferred teams, I would not get promotion
She wasn't even being transparent
She was just saying that so I'd stay
Sure
WHo else is staying?
What about Albert and Paulina?
Well Serge should rent car
Cause > 25
Doesn't it also make sense for y'all to rent a car?
It is 1 car and 1 motorcycle?
So instead of 2 cars
She says no
Why is Aki day only?
But if I rent car it's like $130
It's a $40 delta
He's at a tech summit
To $50
You ask>?
Also what's Connie
Connie's conversation likelyhood if she has to pay an extra $50?
LOL well it'd be $110
Right but it's an extra $110
So I'd have to pay an extra $50?
Why?
Ask Connie if she's down to split a $40 rental?
I ride my motorcycle to camping
One condition though
Much more expensive
LOL oh true
What does Dhruv say?
I felt like it wasn't quite historically accurate
Maybe Aaron spent his time doing thingds
That's true
Hmm
The thing is Hamilton is the guy who wrote a lot
https://www.quora.com/Does-Hamilton-the-musical-portray-Aaron-Burr-fairly
Right
Saying that Burr < Hamilton doesn't say much
Right
We're not discussing good vs bad
We're discussing important vs unimportant
This one answers the question
https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/30/liberals-love-alexander-hamilton-but-aaron-burr-was-a-real-progressive-hero/?utm_term=.45c8b209ac1d
Burr did A LOT OF THINGS
So the article basically shows Depth vs Breadth
Hamilton did much less
It's a lot easier to remember someone who did one big thing than a bunch of medium sized things
That's why I find it weird that Benjamin Franklin is so well known
And took up a lot of causes
But what he did do was more concrete
Hamilton was always an anomaly. He advocated for a monarchy
Right. Not even like washington
Do you think AOC could have ever worked?
He was so far to the right compared to others
The only reason he wasn't dismissed as a de facto self-hating Tory was because AOC was such a failure
So I thought AOC was great
Did AOC even have a way for us to interact with other countries?
At the time I loved Ron Paul
No standing army
Yeah definitely
As in the colonizers revolted
Would have we become independent in the 1960s when the rest of Africa became independent?
And no natives because genocide
Only other country where colonizers revolted I can think of is South Africa
The US is just so unique
Not the colonized
Hmm true
And Australia both became pretty successful countries
Think about it
South Africa
US
Really? Was Simon Bolivar from the colonizers?
Whereas most other colonies did not do well
He was Creole
Okay, but no native genocide
Oh
So also like had good relations with Spanish royalty
Australia also wiped out the Aboriginals.
Well why did Latin America fail?
Was it political or economic?
Native in-fighting?
So most Creole GTFOed.
True
Versus Simon was an exception
He was a Creole
But it wasn't a Creole revolution per se
Right
Until post-civil-war
So I don't think America was what we'd consider a developed country vis-a-vis Europe
Right
Yeah
TR  helped it become regional power
We became major regional power post-WWI
Exactly
I blame Obama for that actually
He wanted a new world order built on peace and dialogue
Obama was all about diplomacy
But the world isn't nearly ready for thast
Her should have been very active in Arab spring
EU is unraveling
The problem with tying an institution to the economy is that the institution's strength is subject to the same boom and busts the economy is
Economics as a means to politics is weaker than politics as a means to economics
Hmm I suppose
If there was a supply shock, of course he'd benefit because refiner, and sell oil for higher prices
I guess you just have to build insititutions around the business cycle
That's what Rockefeller did with Standard Oil
He positioned the company to succeed by either a boom or a bust
But if they drilled too much and the price sank (and sometimes it would to 1/100 of it's price if a new oil field was discovered), he exploited the shit out of the drillers by selling them really expensive storage
And after a certain amount
Would just keep the oil
LOL yeah
But China was crazy
I don't have good esteem of most journalists
Changed in 15 years
They aren't cheap at all
The good ones are brilliant
But the average ones are pretty du,b
I don't know why they kept the pointer abstraction in Go
Weird
Why does it matter in a manager language?
Oh sorry, meant managed language
Probably Prolog
What is a manager language?
Also it's impossible to discuss computer science in Chinese
What if not in US though?
Cause can define promotion rules
True
Didn't use Google translate
Chaima
Computer science
I recognize the characters
Well I know the first character is like chang
Because of sound radicals
It has the same radical
Then I obviously know second one is ma
The other is ma
Looks like soup
So I know one is ch
So not hard to guess
Field?
Yeah
Okay
I only recognized ma
I lied
Hmm
Airport
Chang
And was like it's too characters
And one is ma
So of course it's chaima
True
Is combinator
How discuss CS in Chinese?
But there are no words for combinator or automata or closure or currying
But know word in Chinese for automata
Or lambda
组合子
But why is it different than 组合?
This is a combinator?
The Y-Combinator is not a device
Why device?
Dumb
Why not?
Hmm good point
Because if change one word in sentence in English
Have to change every word
Yeab
right
hmm
But no type classes or anything
Gonna head home and do that now
Invite Bai to event? She has car
We can have some good conversations with the hand
No
But dude
Why not invite Tess and Joanne?
LOL true
Both have cars
Right?
Did Dhruv respond yet?
Does it include tasting?
It's cool to see how they do things
I'm interested from an eng perspective
Well that number means nothing
We need to juxtapose with just tasting
Hmm
Like test driving cars?
Really?
You can just walk into a winery and taste?
I call tomorrow morning
Okay
Ugh
Wait why not ask Joanne or Tess?
Wait I have an idea
If Aki is renting a car
Why doesn't he go back with Emily?
Also save on the underage fees
Emily has enough room in her car?
Serge isn't coming
Man we just have two new vehicles
Where are you?
You really want to drive your jaguar
I really want to drive my motorcycle
Dude where?
How get back after drinking? But I guess so. We could always go a bit north
Later on
Okay
Okay
It is $65/person for alpha Omega. Already booked for 11am. Are you sure you wanna do all 4?
No this is tasting
Just this?
Okay one more
No yours?
Haha
Okay
No I forgot to ask
How about the next one at 1pm?
No tours?
Or write code generators
Isn't that the same idea?
You can also do macros
That's what the Tchannel lib does
What?
Hmm new manager is gr9
Still don't like the product team
I said I wanted to use CEP, ML, and Spark
He said he has experience in ML
He said I could use all 3
Yeah...
Yiqing had to be replaced...
LOL pretty nice
I interview soon
Not ready yet
But I'm not as smart as you
Need to easily solve Hard leetcode problems first
Just too lazy
You can
But you never code anymore...
I book meadowood for dinner?
Make group chat?
Okay
🐮
🐮
🐮
Idk
Roobin posted in the group
This is flaking bro
Good by 10am?
I think it should be okay. I'll call but will make me look like a dick
Like they don't have conflict
It's more like lack of consideration
They literally just don't want to get out of bed
Event date was literally 10am
And I put my credit card info down for the afternoon
Right. I'm afraid they'll flake on the event altogether
Morning is $60/person
$65 per person
So total is $125
What's their final decision?
Whether they come morning or afternoon?
Like as in "I have EQ"
They didn't even ask first...
Like "I realize I RSVPed to an event that clearly started at 10am and you already booked tours but would it be too much trouble to adjust them?"
"There are other people in the world besides me"
Okay
So how many people for morning tour?
Kk
So awkward
Then you just add felby to the chat
Np
Yeah dude
🐮
Rip my reputation
Hmm okay asked Jenny to come to symphony may 31
Good sign?
Oh yaaaaaas
Need many for gbt
Lol
What time?
So would prefer earliesh
Like leave by 12pm
I might wanna go for a ride
Idk probably will sleep lateish
But idk what I'm doing tonight
I'm just playing it by ear?
What time?
Sounds good
Kk
Tomales?
Okay
Okay
Oh god
You going clubbing Tonifht right?
🐮
Temple?
How much does it cost?
But just ask chris. If he says no I won't take it personally. Cause like he doesn't know me
Unless you just want to chill with him haha
🐮
So we do ride at 12pm
I'm going floating at 10:30AM tomorrow morning
Or how about install mod at 11:30am
Okay
I got floating this afternoon
Nevermind
We do that together
BTW I also have to install mod on motorcycle
But mine should be fast
https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/rg-racing-frame-sliders-suzuki-gs500f-2004-2010
Should take 10-15 min
Look at pic
I do this another time
Actually nevermind
It's that knob that sticks out
So acts as a suspension
So your motorcycle skids
Imagine your bike falls
So first the knob acts as a break
The rod connecting the two is mallable
This will never happen to me
Wow
People go into CS
Not in silicon valley
But usually end up in the Portland or Eugene tech scene
I'm not saying no one makes it out here
But I bet like half of your class is here
IDK
Why?
Oh nice
For what?
So what if you wash your hair?
You're dying your hair?
Permanently?
I'd let it fade away
Not like saying don't do it
But if it's gonna be black anyway
So it lasts like 3 months
Dying your hair is bad for it
Nah dude
You're going off the deepend
Once you die your hair
You are never satisified
You'll probably do blond with streaks of black in it next
Moo
Then some green
Actually check congay
Omg so brae
No not about that
Lol
Why call?
Why hanging with Andy?
TFTI
Dude wat
Of course
Lol I'm going clubbing at DNA
Come where?
Oh dude
There was a women at the Rabbi's house named ava
Dude at Muni street car
Coming as fast as possible
Almost at Van Ness station
Omg
Crap Muni took longer than expected
5 more min
Now
Come
Actually can we do 1:30 or so? Still got weed hangover
Shit just made ramen
Lol kinda foggy
Where did you wanna go?
Lol just come eat here
Or get a sandwich
Idk
Already made food
Kk
Be home in 10
Okay
Gotta put away helmet
Gonna leave at 9
Don't wait for me
Having trouble sleeping
这个是什么？
🐮
你的中文不太好
🐮
怎么说AF?
牛奶
Felby wants back of motorcycle today
🐮
Oh dud
Hmm
Wow, you must be writing a really long message
Scared tho
Fomo
But fb messenger said you were
🐮
Cate?
Dude so scared
Oh just saw on internet
Yeah dude
She's ridden before
So knows how to not be brae
So less scared
She won't do that
Like most passengers freak out when you lean into a turn
And stay up right
Which means you lean more
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
Lol
🐮
Picking up felby af rn
So nervous
🐮
Thanks dude
Nice
I guess the fact that I'm hearing voices was fine
I am more than one person
No thank you
I guess we do
FYI this campsite has no trees or anything
Not secluded at all
But if group wants
Mendocino has dispersed camping
Super secluded
Yeah
Which is just camp wherever
Wanna do sometime?
IDK
Wanna do with mushrooms?
Happens
Oh dud
Do they want to use?
LOL wat saying?
But that's an FP question
functional programming
Fuck
Harman said I have to make decision by eow
My manager
I mean kinda
Not really
But the new IO manager wants me to tell him if I'm joining his team by EOW
Hmm lol yeah
Like I can commit and then just reneg
But is brae
Exactly
No response from Blend...
LOL
Haha
Was joking
Lol I don't think it has to be this quick
Talked to Chris jo
Lol
He also said was not brae to just commit and quit
But then they won't promote
But Taz says she would
Lol true
I smoke salvia
Kk
Talk Thursday?
True
Wait we chill tonight?
Then invite you
Nah dude wanna try tonight alone
Will also bring to camping too
Lol I'm sure I'll be fine
Thank
Why does Taz think I'd ever stay?
Taz this
How dumb rn?
Work is so boring
This is absurd
Rest or rpc?
Hnmm
Oh know
Oh dude
We design new TCP and service discovery protocol
Call it SOAP
At Blend
Give location tracker for chaima
Chaima af
Right now
Where is chaima?
🐮
🐮
🐮
True
True
🐮
All hands
🐮
Taz is giving presentation on trust
Omg
What? I don't trust her
Yeah I can too
It's more like I'm shutting the door versus leaving it possibly open
Exactly
So shitty
🐮
You think?
Lop
🐮
Still so mad
I literally have no viable options
Taz outlined the parameters
He said I had to decide by Friday
She said had to be 6-months
How can Taz ask me to make a committment?
No
He didn't
Stay through end of year
Is what she wants
Uh
Too risky
I know
I feel like it's so unfair
Not only did she not fight for me to get the teams I wanted
Do I? What if I just lie?
Not only did she say my promotion was contigent on staying
But then what?
True
But then what happens to my career?
but don't have good offer yet
But then I'm kinda in insecure position
I don't want to be unemployed
Right
But like the other risk is I just commit
And then brae
And much less risky
Can still be put up for promo
Hmm but she knows I put her in the position in the first place
I have literally NEVER had a good experience with one
NEVER
Why are EMs being so shitty?
I have no options!
How is this not manipulative?
6 months
So this is someone's career and dreams and happiness she is fucking with
Right but she gave me nothing
She can't give me any break?
So I can't take anything personally but if I do something brae she'll get mad and tell everyone about it?
If it isn't than why would she put in effort to spread a bad reputation?
Hmm
Maybe I can just join docs if they don't require commitment.
He already asked me
But like why is this a good job? You literally make people unhappy
But it's also learning to empathize with people yet ignore them
🐮
Blend got back to me
Said resume sucked
Also heard from Juan and Taz I was bad candidate
But seriously
Good message?
#communication
LOL
So confused
What?
What?
Triggered
haha come try tonight
Let me check
Dude I'm still freaked out
Yeah man
You'll enjoy
But like it's pretty amazing
Just a bit shaken
I'm super glad I did it
This is what happened
http://www.salvia-trip.net/exp/scariest_experience_of_my_life-e1188/
To me
Did you read?
lol
OH yaaas
What time?
Might be going to Amazon event until 10pm
Not like Google who just sits on their ass
Amazon is good company
Can't just apply to Blend
They innovate so much
Or evil like Facebook
Yeah true
Lol
Lop
Man
Such an awful way to be
Like why be so shitty
Right
Okay this is not what I want lol
Hmm
That's not actually a bad idea
I need to learn more stochastics
What if tomorrow Taz says need 6-month commitment to any driver team?
And then what?
I hope something bad happens to her
I hope she never reaches director
Tomorrow
Independent related events!
Then Harman says he wants decision by Friday
Idk
She was like "take your time"
She scheduled it then
Then schedules a sync for Friday
Hmm
Sounds good
Sure
Yeah I'll definitely make sure we're adequately supplied
You do salvia tonight
Haha we might have to leave campsite
If near other people
Wait dude
Oh true
Salvia though?
In your room?
Your jacket is in my room
Btw getting jacket
Come get
Wat was that?
It was squeaky af
Why take Muni back?
Come tho
Bored af
When I get back
🐮
Okay
True
🐮
Always
Monday
Gotta study af
Scheduled a TPS with them
Wat
Koush?
Oh I see
But why walk out?
Oh I see
Should I stop the troll?
Bert
Bert
Bert
LOL tru
Come to second floor
Ava
Stephanie and I are hanging
🐮
What time?
6:30
Heading over now
Ok
They had no chargwrs
Just suck
Idk
Lol
Lol wat
Why thinking about it now?
Nothing
Just chilling
He was awesome
But he didn't like me
Lol maybe
Because second tps
He was like "wonderful talking to you, please email me if you have any questions in the meantime"
Lol yeah IDK
Probably
Feel free to come chill
I feel like these things exist already
http://mobile.databasejournal.com/features/mysql/slideshows/top-10-mysql-gui-tools.html
Lol I'm just kidding
Would you write it?
Does he fomo?
Do you like Jeff?
I gave him the spiel about sets not really being o(1)
He was like super down to nerd out
He also disagreed tortoise and the hair would work to find cycles in a DAG
*hare
Yeah exactly
Also you wanted to create udeploy so you can know which revision is on prod
Well if you copy udeploy exactly, not sure you'd meet that goal
Pls
"works*
I'd just do mesos first
Do y'all containerize?
It's older now
It's healthy has deteriorated
That's what I said earlier
You treat a DC as a computer
It has RAM (redis)
It has storage (DB)
and it has an access buss (the network)
Mesos was written using the same architecture as the Linux kernel
It has a CPU (hosts)
It's kinda like LSD
Clusto
Distributed key value sto
Store
But not elastic
Also if a host is bad mesos will replace it
Yeah
We had recommendations from ucapacity
But clusto and mesos don't orchestrate the deploy
That's what docker does.
They provide entities and drivers
Anyway I guarantee mesos is better
Idk how kubernetes works at all
To store what hosts simcom owned??
For example?
Yeah
Raft af
Yeah
Clusto would automatically help run puppet
How is blend any better?
Why not mesos?
So mesos is like an OS
doesn't include the software but can fit any use ca see e
Case
Spark
Mapreduce
Et
Like marathon
Kubernetes is like firmware
Provides a more restricted set of tasks
So works out of the box
Rest applications
But you need to run the software on it
But has the complete functionality end to end
Permissioning should be stored in like etcd IMO
But I think it kinda distracts
You don't have to explicitly name etcd
But definitely not ETL
Why distract people?
Like etcd is pretty much the exact use case
So people will ask you why need etl?
And wonder themselves
Not be sure what you're getting at
Then they start worrying a out an ETL
I'm saying it's like suggesting you use celery as a message brokering system
I'd pay a lot of attention to that
Because it makes no sense
Same with ETL
I'm kinda high rn
But extract transform and load
Right but usually offline
No need to ETL
Oh not related to security
I misread
Separate items
You mean serialize and deserialize?
I didn't see paragraph break
Yeah
That's why I was so maf
I was like "fuck what is Jason thinking"
Add airflow to list
Dag based tasks
It's like celery but as a tag
Oh dude
*dag
That's literally airflow
I was never asked
We never discussed
That's never happened
Didn't ever happen
But your mom did
Hmm
Right I know
So I'd put airflow down there
Why not?
Processing mortgage applications
How do?
Why not?
Lol
Kinda nice to just smoke and get very lightly high
I can still get super high if I want
Right but I'm saying my current state is better
But more fine grained control
It does
Salads are great
🐮
Oh
Haha
Jenny af
Lol nothing
Ugh
Haha
I had a dream I fucked this girl I had a crush on in high school
Oh really?
Hmmm
Why?
Yeah same
Oh god
Why drink?
Oh dude
Maybe the milk tea made you anxious
Like the concept of bubble tea was disturbing to you
Oh god
So anyway I fucked her
And I was like "fuck not again"
Even though in real life she doesn't
But in the dream she looked like vochelle
Anyway then I like fell asleep on the street in a sleeping bag
But was like "nah, too comfortable here"
Then I woke up next morning to hear police blasting intercom at me to get up
But when opened my eyes couldn't see outside
And was like "I should probably call an Uber home"
Saw my room
And took awhile to see that I was outside
Then I had to go take an AP lit test
So I asked Emily what taciturn meant
After then just more chaos
She was like "I don't know, Ari"
Also koushik af
Read top photo
TFTI
Oh tell
Oh nice
Lol
The dream went from wacky to wholesome
Funny we both dreamed about school
Wow
Lol yeah
I think it's triggered by interviewing
Ive been dreaming about school a lot
It was called "hello moo!"
Is mesos like Lsd in your opinion?
How no?
Tonight?
Actually gonna ride through southbay
Oh true
Staying for dinner
Helix office
Chill tonight?
I'm here
Hiking
Probably 9:30-10
Lol okay
Did he like?
Goodo
Hmm people at blend seem smarter
But helix is better space
Haha
Both seemed smart
Yeah
Cool thing about helix is a lot of the engineers have chemistry and biology backgrounds
Bioinformatics
And like to see how CS and their sciences interact
Right but this isn't BME
Leadership of eng is standard silicon valley
Director is from Adobe, etc
Lol true
Yeah
How do you think I got here?
Took page mill to 35
After interview
Also page mill is hard AF on motorcycle
Yaaaas
This girl is so entertaining
Come at 9:40
9:50
Come
What was?
Okay
What talk about?
What was a waste of time?
Who broached subject?
Just nervous to hear back from heliz
Oh lol
What they say?
Not too fomo
Were they like mine?
Yeah sounds about right
Today apparently
I think so
Blend interviews are harder
And people are younger
But product space isn't as exciting
San Carlos
Large scale data?
Helix is genomics
What about nerdy exciting?
They said I was interviewing for platform
FOMO
Right but chaima should FOMO
Chaima needs to be more empathetic.
Yaas
Empathy training
Dude if you take salvia you probably will become chaima
You gotta try salvia
Lol
Come
Thank
Bring friends
Bar fun af
Lol just chilling now
Oh god
Not global warming
It rains in the summer all the time
Maybe did a few times
Not in SF?
But what if you were away when it did?
Still no Blend
Nervous af dude
Nope
Just nervous
Also wtf helix
Hello,

I had a wonderful time interviewing at Helix last Tuesday and would like to thank you for hosting me!

I just wanted to check in because I remember Derek telling me that I would hear back by the end of the week. I'm not in a rush or anything -- just wanted to check-in before the weekend.

Cheers,
Ari
What think?
I interviewed at Tuesday
just wanted to check in because I remember Derek telling me that I would hear back byWednesday (but I might be remembering incorrectly)
What about that?
Okay
Sent
I see
That makes sense
True
Their coordinator went OOO
Dude such an on point dream
Why are my dreams always so shit?
Also still no helix
Ugh what think of helix response
I know
Blend also silent
So nervous dude
Lol yeah dude
But I guess life is hard
Just want this to be over with
You think blend is no?
True
Lol
Fomo
Chaima af
So hard to work
Between helix and Jenny
Nervous af
Lol wat
Is good?
How respond?
It's weird
Like she left and gave big hug and was like "good luck on your commute home haha"
And super friendly
And then tone changed suddenly
You saw messages
And also she never moved away or anything
She invited me to dick pics haha
Was like "please come, talked to the organizers for you,they said you can come"
And then afterwards was like "okay we chill but have dinner at 9pm with friend"
And then she's like "eh I'll skip dinner and get drinks afterwards with my friend"
Nah
Ryan says to say because I like you but I think that comes off as desperate
It's been 2...
But like idk if that's the right way to be concrete
Yeah if you count those
I also don't know what she's driving at
Hah
It's just sappy and cliche
Like it's such a weird thing to bring up regardless
And it's even weirder to bring up out of nowhere with no clear guidelines of how to respond
Brae AF
Then suddenly bring up?
Like why say tonight was fun
I'd like to assume that but it's a little bit difficult
"yeah, but not close enough"
"the enchantment was strong"
How?
"your beauty acted as a locomotive force"
"I take that metaphorically"
If ya wanna go to countercultural stuff
Come to this event:
Right next door
I know the girl who runs it
It's gonna be a psychedelic album with cool audio-visuals
This  is the girl who hosts BDSM workshops and shit

Da Cha Dan
You're just talking about food
Oh it isn't?
Right I remember Cha now
Lol
Lol why?
Oh but why not?
But the changes are already reflected in workday...
LOL
What about your promise?
And will staying on the team mean a promotion?
Got neither
You told me two things when I stayed at Uber: 1. Promo 2. Get a team I really wanted
Why not?
Your English is too good
How is the stuff?
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
🐮
Maybe drugs help?
Lol
Kk
Omg
🐮
Hmm but also just more noise
Depends on what "forgotten" means
Is 1 enough?
Exact
Also how many people need to actually remember?
But both are small
Oh dude
Honestly kinda sad
China in some ways has gone down hill
Now just an urban jungle of tasteless skyscrapers
The cities used to be so beautiful and unique
In what sense?
Hmmm
Just people only talk about Beijing and Shanghai?
Hmm that's true
So you're saying plenty of cities are just the same as 90s
How is historical preservation?
Oh actually FOMO
Down
I like that it's not just house or trap
EDC sounds pretty good
It sounds like a hella good time
Was EDC your first intro to PLUR?
I have candy :p
LOL nothing sounds spiritual about it
Not at all
Hippies in the 60s actually liked ideas
I don't buy into it
It just seems kinda culty
Okay
Oh okay
I'll be at work
MemSQL af
Let's talk about this during smoke
What? Down to hang?
Okay just ping me
I'll try to get him now
9pm?
Okay
Hmm that's what I felt back in 2016 too
Every interaction felt cheap
🐮
Memsql?
🐮
Yeah?
Andrey?
Oh haha
Yeah
Grace qi
How did Libby Change?
I'm trying to think evolutionarily why small talk developed
Yeah
What makes someone "cool" or "approachable"?
The "cool" kids at lynebrook were definitely cooler than the cool kids at silverlake
People that are cool definitely act differently in different subcultures
*different, not cooler
But is universal
I kinda get that
And what makes the friendship unique is only you two understand the joke
Because friendships are about sharing in the joke
Is it just acting like someone is your friend?
Because it allows other people to "share" in the jokr
And establishes a shared intimacy
That's why people sometimes bully or taunt to look cool
But smalltalk is circuitous
There are faster ways
That's different
Because dating is based on building up emotional bonds
You don't develop bonds over smalltalk
Friendship is not
Did you do smalltalk at high School?
I usually met someone over homework
We'd be in a group project
And then chat and get to know each other
People would just be talking about it
I'd just scoot over
Otherwise if I heard someone mention and interesting topic
Or ask a question about it in class
And then I'd bring it up with them later
I guess that's how I made solely autistic friends
Oh
That never happened
I never met anyone like that in high school
I can get autistic about anything
Well I find that almost everyone has something they are autistic to
But don't bring up weather
So I usually just try to probe
I hate that a lot
Where from is interesting I guess
Can get interests and perspectives
But also like to just make jokes
I like bantering a lot
But it can come off as rude
A lot of people are insecure
Depends on what you mean
Or just interpret it as not liking them
Is Jenny insecure?
She doesn't have her life all figured out
So isn't sure on what to do
But does she have existential self doubt and confidence issues?
No about both
I started porting your jokes
I told her the half Asian one
Haha
Lol
Btw dude
Dye hair black again
Well the feedback survey results are in
It's hovering at about 0%
🐮
Lol
Well
I'm wondering if people love it in the same way they loved my afro in high school
Right I meant outside of EDC
Oh dude
I do all the time though
Lol nah
Well yeah
Empathy
Huh?
What mean about roobin?
Roobin
Roobin
Happy hour
Hang soon?
Yeah
Feel free to come
Idj
But idk how long it will last
10-30min
🐮
Last night
Fuck dude
So Jenny is moving
Was gonna stay at friend place for a few weeks while gets new job
Last night was like "why don't I live at your place instead?"
No
I know
This happens to every grill I meet...
Yeah exactly
Like why get so aggro suddenly?
I mean she has an aggressive personality
So maybe she just does everything aggro
I suspect Jenny is gonna want to have a talk soonish
Haha
No indication
She hasn't hinted
I know her well enough now
She's insecure about the relationship
And wanted to validate it
She's not insecure about herself
That's normal
I mean the problem is not that she's insecure with the relationship
The problem is that we've been dating for a week and she's bothered by the fact that it's insecure
Why dude? I'm not that great
That's what I think
I could be wrong
She's definitely clingy
Then she's lying about her past
She talks about her past relationships as if they were lukewarm
True
And you might just go back to jochelle and jings
True
maybe I'm just reading too much into it
Oh no Alex Forsythe
You like?
U like?
I really like him
He was nerdy?
The guy with glasses?
The musician?
Oh not like no social skills
🐮
I see
But why only hang with other engineers?
It's painful
Yeah exactly
But I usually just say "let's talk later"
But yeah
Ah tomales
Haha
Yeah what think of ankush grill?
Who knows
Yes
Yeah felt the same way
Idk
When what?
Haha why?
Her name is not spelled that way though
On fb
https://www.facebook.com/greeneggsandbacon
How was it?
Awkward
Awkward
Awkward
I see
She seems to think it's awkward
Nothing was
Oh I should have inspect-elemented Diamond's
I retrofitted Felby's
It's fun
Hmm Taz said no. Manager said he wants to promote next cycle
Ugh I know I hate it
Feel super burnt out
Yeah, makes me anxious though
Just had terrible luck applying
I just want to relax and code a bit
And learn on my own
Yeah agreed
Makes you not top of your game
Because not really practicing
Agreed
I want to get revenge on Taz though
Somehow
Forest knolls actually
Walk in GG park
Or rather Forest Hill
Super nice out tonight
I feel so peaceful and happy
Wat?
🐮
Clay pot with Jenny?
What doing?
Oh wat doing?
Oh true
Nick af
Nick af
I don't think so
Yeah
Koushik is now against partying
But there's always koushiks
Suddenly felt super happy and at peace
I felt like I was rolling last night
Lasted for like 1 hour
Oh hmmm
Lucky you get those moments a lot
At work???
Haha
Don't code
Start hugging all your coworkers
Why not at work?
Haha
Why not working?
Haha
Fomo

Okay
Lol much better than diesel
Diesel uses air
So couldn't be under water
Yeah
Did diesel charge the battery?
Wow
Sounds like civ in a sense
Hahahaha
But it's not part of ecma?
Really? Console.log is new?
Oh god

But like the one of your car from two years ago was pretty good
Kk
So mad
Wtf is this bullshit?
It was so fun
Why does California have to ruin everything?
Fuck Jerry Brown
Hes a first class idiot
He does other stupid things
He's the ringleader of the circuw
Circus
He passed this new education formulq
Which gives disadvantaged schools more money
But then no directives on how to spend
🐮

Where are what?
Oh shit
Really?
Is it closed?
Oh shit!
Where?
Oh wat
I come?
So like 2 hours away
Oh dude
Oh true
Is it a nice house?
Oh
Hmm
Ride the horses?
Lol living on a farm is a lot of worj
But not stressful work
Just time consuming
Which is a good way to retire
Still get responsibilities and purpose
Maintain your character
Yeah
And no crops
Which is the major source of stress for farmers
I feel like that's not enough
Maybe for the cows
But the horses?
Lol is your dad gonna ride?
Is he gonna break them?
That's what training them means
Lol that's only when Cam's girlfriend sits on them
Cam
Good
That was 6 months ago...
You fomo?
Uh
Went up and asked him "how's hi"?
*ji
And he said "we broke up"
Lol
She was literally out of his league
11pm
Okay
K
I am stopping home by 6:45pm
Yes
Lol she won't be there
If I can't fit it
I'll put it under your doormat
True

To intellectualism
Put the music under your doormat
No time to check
🐮
Lol why?
Message Jenny
Roobin is coming back tonight?
Oooh
But might reschedule that to Monday
So Jenny is having a party until 10pm
And I might have drinks with the Rabbi
Lol dude short notice af
Lol yeah but not necessarily kicking a girl I'm dating out at the last minute
Oh
Wait
Lol
I'm def coming
Haha
Then yeah
Might include Jenny though
Yeah
Sometimes
Hahaha
Haha yeah
Probably
Lol
I thought you meant no Jenny
I see. We can def arrange Bros only night too. But I don't think that would work tonight
Hahahaha no I get why it's scary
It's something you don't want to touch
Ikd
Idk
Had a dream about ghosts once
Kept trying to touch me
So I talked to Kartik about how he deals with nested functions and syntax
He said the goal is to conceptually understand the code
It just reads the word parts
He can infer where the curly braces are just be understanding the logic
So it doesn't really read out the syntax to him
Like he can conceptually tell by how the code works what a closure would be
And he knows the language
So can guess what it actually looks like
Same for closures
Right so then he can turn on the syntax
It even has a mode where it reads out how many spaces there are before the line
I'm on call
Fuck kinda want to try it if we go camping
No like I might take Jenny camping
It is July 4-11
I wish I got contact info?
I might wanna get more
Maybe I can trip while you do shrooms?
Tell who?
Where?
So no hangout?
Just went to bar
Hung with Connie and Jenny
Yeah
Can you send me your camping list?
Yes of shit to bring
The Google doc
There wasn't a camping checklist for Costco?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2qpnkJvyEpqHHzkUOBeBlCIlGH_YLT5q87f-xx6HPI/edit
Does costco sell camping stoves?

New team is fun
Fun but not super partt
Chill people and technically very strong
But not opinionated or arrogant
But not super broey or anything
Manager invited us to come chill at his house though
I wish was more down to party
But good for career development in long term
I mean never asked. But not part of culture
Everyone leaves at 6pm
Lol true
Idk why
Maybe will try soon
Kinda new to team so don't want to try it yet
But maybe in 1-2 weeks when people get back from OOO
To get drinks
It's a step
It's never gonna be Uber 2015
No plans
Why?
Nah on call
Can I invite the blind intern to oysters?
Oh yeah
What time?

Is beautiful
Super sunny and warm
Just laying around
Where?
Parents?
Got enough girl stories though?
Get an Uber
That was a test
What doing?
I go to stern Grove
Fomo meters
Making sure readings are adequate
It's not easy or laid back
It's a bit stern
Come though
2pm
Eating breakfast
Yeah
Show what?
Shrooms on Sunday?
No
Why?
Check my timeline
Oh
Joey Huang and Monica Phan
Two yuppy Asians in their late mid twenties, one male and one female
Okay
That's more like it
I said "I'm Ari" and he said "I'm Joey"
That's how we met
San Francisco
Monica is his friend
Wait so met Joey, he's a designer on onboarding
Lol
But where saw Taz?
Oh tru
I know you didn't actually see her
Oh true
Haha
WFH
Sick
Eating
🐮
What doing?
I'm coming
On my motorcycle
Oh like 20?
Also can Jenny ride in your jaguar?
Yeah dude
How much did we get with Tiffany?
Okay, I won't invite her to everything
But if we are just smoking in my apartment
I might still invite her from time to time
You really don't like her that much?
That makes sense
I see
I guess same as how I feel about Tiff
Nah don't hate her
Just get really pissed off when I hang out with her
LOL
Okay
I see
Roobin
2 times per dau
Probably at least 10 times
Yes
Roobin
Would you watch?
Yes
Do shrooms with Allen?
Sunday
Lin?
What doing?
Hmm then when?
What time visiting parents?
Eh I want to do it during the day
If do it at 9am, it will be gone by 3pm
Or 4pm
Impatient af
I really want to trip on Sunday
Hmmm
I'll try to find that third one that I lost
Packed it camping but can't find where I put it
True
Yeah
Because I kinda want to try it alone too
God I should have gotten her phone number
I trust them
He doesn't have mushrooms
The only non-jank alternative is the dark net
And that is pretty risky
So what are you asking?
So what do I trust?
Okay, so there's a few scenarios
2. She sells us chocolates with normal mushrooms -- no big deal
1. She's selling us just empty chocolates -- no big deal
3. She sells us poisonous mushrooms -- very unlikely
4. She sells us normal mushrooms laced with LSD -- we trip for longer than expected
Dosage of LSD is too high?
5. She sells us mushrooms laced with RC -- bad
You need like 12,000 micrograms of LSD to overdose
Normal tabs are like 100 MG
Drug communities are very reputation based
We can get a testing kit if you're this concerned
I see
RC is probably the likely alternative
I mean you can never test that she isn't giving us rat poison
But claims without evidence can be dismissed without evidence
But if we actually detect psychobin, it's unlikely there is anything else
But we should also dismiss claims that it's unsafe
Yes
Unless there's evidence to back it up
So like that's a real possibility
So like dousing normal mushrooms with RC is somewhat common
Rat poison is not
Generally produces bad trips and has lasting effects and can be dangerous in large doses
It's a synthetic hallucinagen
That's what Koushik and Ankush did
Yeah
Oh true
Do you use mockgen?
Btw got more tabs
http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html
I mean I've read the article
Wait just open link and take a like
It's just a good place to start
If you have question I can answer
Sure but a monad is not just a context
So not boring
Like a context is just a simplified term of an algebraic data structure applied to a group of objects
Keep reading
Great
Lol
Learn about what the algebraic data types are
Lol when I get home from work?
It's a lot harder to understand if you've done LSD
Real LSD
Easier to understand
But the article explains what they are
Programming language design doesn't?
It's pretty cool
Like don't you wonder how you'd make a state machine in a functional language?
"or how quantum entanglement allows transmitting the knowledge of the wavefunction collapse across indeifnite space instantenously"
But we don't know
I do too but can't Google it
It has to with diagnalization of non real vectors
Right
Why not?
What we intuitively understand is physics in a real plane
Unless talking about EM
That's a good way of modeling quantum behavior
When you throw non real numbers into problems usually done with reals
I'm bullshitting
Hmmm
Something big
There's rumors about something related to Uber
Takes a year lol
But like not exactly an IPO
I tell tonight
Did you say that to her?
That's reasonable
Yeah
So he's like making sure you do the whole thing
Because he might see you and think you're just doing your plate
Oh
My mom did something kinda similar
But she would justify things after I agreed
"can you clean up the living room?"
"it's just that I'm super stressed out right now and can't keep doing everything myself"
"sure Mom"
Guilt tripping is only useful when someone doesn't want to do something
Now I feel guilty and shitty and I was gonna do it anyway
Yeah
What think?
🐮
http://cubicao.com/theory/index.html
The time cube doesn't rotate
No
Earth rotates within the timecube
Really?
Why does Ryan ignore?
Won't trust me but believes in invisible Man in the sky
He listens to some decrepit old backwards guy
Every Sunday he gets up early and goes to this big room
Talk about man walking on water
Guy splitting the sea
A psychopathic god
He sings music that has less rhythmic ingenuity than twinkle twinkle Little star
He sings about how he likes being controlled by an entity more angry, more arbitrary, and more backwards than he
He likes to visualize this guy watching his every move every day
Every shower he takes he imagine this guy watching and recording him
Every girl he fucks
Is Pandora bar 21+?
Only reason wanted to with Ryan's event was because she leaves soon
Same person
So probably can't
But she's 20
Lol true
It just kinda feels shitty to not ever be able to bring my own friend to events
So like I can't ever bring friends ever to an event?
What does "these events" mean?
Yeah not saying he isn't
I agree I went overboard with the Ryan event
Oh okay
I thought you mean that I can't bring friends to events in general that you and Ryan host
I thought you mean like "you can hang with your friends but don't invite them to events me and Ryan generally host/organize"
"just hang out with her then
like not to these events"
Right I'm not saying asking is unreasonable
I thought you were categorically saying "Don't bring your friends to the events I organize"
Of course you should always ask
Oh okay
But you DID invite her to oysters
LOL true
Me
That I have to deal with tomorrow
Now I'm kinda mad about it
She will follow me around
LOL
Yeah
True
IDK that's true
Oh BTW
Because when she left she was like "I think Stephanie was super impressed with me"
Oh hmm
Did you ever check if Stephanie liked her?
When back?
Maybe I invite Hannah then
Hannah
3 weeks
var stack = new Stack()
index = 0;
l = len(name)
while index < len / 2 {
    stack.push(name[index])
}
Nevermind
LOL
I can do this in place
No lol
I love how we both thought of the same thing
Oh I was implementing isPalandrome()
How is that solving it?
No
This will work with hannha
Gracefully handles differences between even and odd
Nice
Yeag
Yaeg
It's me
Costoco when?
FOMO
Nah
NO it doesn't.
For the request schema, you can't go required -> optional
That's how to not make breaking changes
For the response schema, you can't optional -> require
If you add a parameter that is actually required but mark it optional, your code will just break your service
So you'll return a 500 instead of a 400
Think about it this way:
If it's not actually required by your code it should have never been required in the first place
Okay coming
When is he coming?
LOL okay sure
Is Jenny still there?
Or did she go back to LA?
Jenny af
Now some random girl in socal is gonna think I'm weird af
NOOOO
Okay coming
Or you bought them
This book is bullshit
Thrift you slap over HTTP
It is end-to-end ready
It allows you to use HTTP like an RPC
Protobufs is actually an SOA system designed from the ground up
It's analogous to the tchannel+hyperbahn+thrift suite of software
The difference is that it actually works really well. And it's really, really fast.
Ok
Yeah in like 5 mins
Do I need to buy?
KKathy
Okay
Doing now
Oh no
Hahaha
???
Oh he said it wouldn't work
So confused
He had a conflict
Yeah
Then no mushrooms?
That is a lot if people tho
What about shrooms though?
Hmmm
But if we do shrooms then they do acid the timing will be off
Ok
4 people is a lot for acid tho
Hmmm
If acid works it can be a very deep emotional experience
Lol I guess is fine
It's important for there to be complete trust and confidence
Yeah but on a deep level I'm comfortable with him
Hmmm
What frustrated you?
You need to let down your barriers and say whatever is on your mind without fear of being judged
Yeah. Did you just go with it or were you trying to fight it?
Hmmm
Problem is we hit the deepest part in a sushi shop
Do you trust Alex?
And it was relatively weak
Ah. I don't
I am deeply suspicious of most people
And Alex?
Ok
Yeah
But like this trip I might wander away at times
I'm gonna ride through Oakland hills
Hmm
And see if there's a good spot
Nah
*want
You won't things with complex geometric patterns
That's the other problem with beaches
Yeah
I prefer feeling secluded
Hmm that's true
We talked too much last time
Yeah that was brae
Sorry about that
True
About how he's being thirsty a
What?
AF?
What about it?
Haha. Found the third mushroom
Hmm
When coming?
Haha
About
About to go moto
Okau
So then it's a yes?
If you can be back by 3pm, we can do
Sounds good
Like we meet at Ava
Then go
Gg park?
Hot
80s
But gg park is cooler
Okay
Okay
I talked to Alex
Wait what doing? Why texting?
I don't want him to babysit tho
Are parents driving?
Less visual
More visual
It's a head high
I mean
More deep
🐮
Eta?
Come
Have we made plans for dinner yet?
Lol wanna chill tho?
I'm also down to just Uber eats
I mean in like an hour
I'm not back yet
Time for more sushi
Uber eats delivery is gonna get here before I do
Mine getting it?
*mind?
Heading back right now
Front
Yeah
It's laskie
Oh shit
He's going back to the front
Right in front
Hmmm should I call?
Wait
I'm about to be here
Okay
Where is towel?
And thanks so much for getting
Okay
Thanks
Tiny
🐮
Well you got a week to decide
It was mild
After I wandered around
Hmmm
Felt like I was wandering through a magical forest
Yeah same
I walked around the ocean
Felt like I was wondering through a beautiful garden
Yeah that's why I went for a walk
I only enjoyed after you left
Yeah man it was magical
That's why need to be walking in nature
That would be bad
Haha. I only felt good after you left
That's just when it hit me
Not because you left
??
http://www.psychedelic-library.org/lifep1.htm
Published in 1957
Super interesting essay on the history of mushrooms
Sorry, that link didn't work
here's the real one: http://www.psychedelic-library.org/life.htm
What is wrong with this sentence: I am growing a mushroom plant?
We can split
Okay mushrooms aren't a plant
PLant means photosynthesis
And LSD and shrooms, both fungi, return people back to nature
It's interesting because mushrooms return matter and nutrients to the soil
I've been doing pottery
Yeah agreed
And stuff
Soma arts center
Doing tonight
Few blocks away from ava
$0
Come?
Idk I'll ask
Is every Monday
That distracts from the underlying unease
But the visions produce a euphoria
Btw most people get nervous about tripping
But probably just Monday
If I trip this Sunday, gonna do two tabs
But if just Jason
Then I won't do
Same reasons you mentioned
Yeah true
Don't want to talk that often
But if you actually are tripping
It's hard because I don't want to talk to people most of the time
But sometimes you can freak out
So need friends there
Because you need to be quiet to kick in
Natives were very careful about how they used them
Ture
The rituals built around using psychedelics makes them magical but comforting
Tooth containers?
What is?
Love it
Haha
Sure
Or nice but dense parts of city
Do you prefer urban jungle?
Or like upper west side?
Like would you like wall street area
So this is upper west side
Still plenty of things to do
But more stately
Super old, stately
That's why I like Paris
But I feel like it will be hipster driven
Maybe
So feels grand and stately
Upper west side was gradually built over many years
But dense
Lots to do
What think?
Israel also has housing crisis
That's probably what's preventing peace with Palestinians tbh
I need to cram Sipser
Fuck
My team wants to implement a DFA
https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X
Yes
Should we add our separate friends to the chat?
LOL work friends
When actually on the event or night before
Group chat is better for real-time chat
Oh true.
FB event is good for persistent details
True
True
Thanks for the help
I still take responsibility for all the planning, but made you co-host so you can invite people and change shit
Tank
What is chaima salary?
What
Yeah but not divulging info online
not quiet
i tell in person
ooooh
yes
how recently?
so dumb
why did he forfeit stocks?
lol
???
Not leave
At least one million
Was probably like $2 million?
Try to sell on secondary market
Yeah you can probably get loans
$5 million?
Anything but sell them!!!
A sure bet of how much money?
That's a false dichotomy. Not only would waiting be a better compromise between money and opportunity, it also allows more meaning
So now he has to go back to a boring job at flexport
Like that didn't work out
Whereas if he was rich af, he could just afford to start something else
Sounded pretty boring tbh
Ah
It was for mgmt, right?
Will taz retaliate?
Hmm okay
How does Blend do perf?
Maybe they just Blend the entire team together
Everyone arimoosters.
He kinda invited himself
He's going back to Minnesota though
Lol yeah it is my event
But I mostly decided it didn't matter cause you weren't coming and Jason Libbey was for it
True
I know!
I didn't!
True
Oh god
Oh good
Imagine tripping with Jenny
He does like to brag and show off
The difference is that James isn't as self absorbed
But he doesn't always just redirect the convo to himself
Hmm
They both are a bit unsettling
BTW Redux is actually just a state monad
Yeah
🐮
Let me check
Liang is pretty down
Yeah will do
Yeah sure
Not angry at her anymore
Jacq?
Haha girl scouts don't camp
BTW are you gonna message anqi and jacq?
No
Cause anqi hates me
True
Just assume all of Jacq's friends hate me
No one except for Jason and Connie liked Jenny
haha I messaged Vicki
I think Jenny was well behaved the night she met Connie
And she's not as bad 1:1
Cause like half of the reason she's brae is because she chooses shit conversation topics
But what really makes people HATE her is when 1. they are against the flow of the conversation 2. when the conversation doesn't change to flow in the direction of the topics no one else wants to talk about, she individually tries to divide the conversation participants by engaging them individually.
Like still brae
2. is the really brae one. She did it to me when we were dating all the time but I just thought it was because we were dating
But girls sometimes do that
Yeah Angie does it a lot
But like didn't realize she did it to everyone
And was just gonna take her up on it later
Yeah same
And the topics she does it with aren't bad though
But not as fiercely as Jenny
Yeah same
Damn
Hmm
Book 1 night or 2 nights?
It has a shower facility
But nearby
No it doesn't.
Eh
Liang's friend
Why did I invite Jing camping?
Looks wise
Liang = Jing
Can't say about yichen
Liang is fobby in the sense that she's a bit quiet and speaks in a Chinese accent
No
She's quiet
But not anti social
Just doesn't always contribute the most
Participates in conversations and stuff
Like she's nods and reacts and occasionally pipes in
But isn't like super loud
Haha
Nah
Xiaowei?
Yeah true. Hmm, maybe Austin level
Dude it's like 2 months from now
Or bin
Frequency of him
Like not social skills of Austin
Oh dude
Where?
Wanna go before then?
Lol down for that
But gonna go camping in two weeks
Go swimming
Why not? Get to hang around on the wilderness
Just me
Oh hmmm
Like he's not the guy who wouldn
No not
't consider it and maybe experiment a little
He's a curious and adventurous person
But like I don't think he is any less straight than the rest of us
But still not down to try it
I told you before that I'm not completely straight
Yeah
Am I a bit bi? Or are you just like super straight?
Question is
That's the question
I'm like a 7 or 7.5
Oh then I'm 2.5-3
Eh I'm not even in that state
Like I'm not down to try
But maybe that's just because don
too nervous
WHo knows
Not how it works though
Doesn't mean frequency
means amplitude
Well means both
Haha
Nice!!
I come to date
Where?
With decoy mustache
Oh really
Nice
Yes
Does chaima do LSD?
K
I'm not gonna tho
Moto tomorrow
Yes
Wait meet at 5:15
Where?
Still at ipot
Leaving
Where?
Not sure
Not soon
You didn't update it
You didn't change the code
Upgrade it
You just made it low quality
Oh wait
A Markov chain?
How build?
Oh lol
So you just have like a prompt and several transition probabilities
And call math.random
Oh
Okay and you used lib to build the Markov chain?
Return true
Oh nice
Oh did you just save it
Haha very simple
And then write a script to traverse Dom and turn it into structure?
Oh fuck I read that script
If Ari turn
So the length is just how many nodes you traverse, right?
But I don't get it
Just built Markov chain of me
Too hard
Origin node should be you
Right but then how build rest of chain to just be me?
Which tbh is probably just a Markov chain
Yeah better than mixed though
Sounds like keyboard output
Okay
Feeling a bit down
I don't want to Nicole and dime you with cheap ones
Just go with that
It's better
Haha
Tho
Agreed thi
10/10 would never meet Priscilla again
Weird af
Don't hate her
Very weird
Still tripping dude?
Normal dude
??
Are you normal?
Yes
🐮
Now
No
Do you have beers?
He never came
Yeah come
Come
You coming?
Why no?
🐮
🐮
BTW found your spare key
Libbey or Robin brought it up a few nights ago
And then never dod
They planned to come back
Did
Gym today?
Got a lot of anger and anxiety I want to burn
Now
Just life
Slow buildup
Anger is better cause can channel into productivity
I isolate between depression and anger
But too much is unmanageable
So just want to put it into becoming a beast
Then can concentrate on self improvement
I've grown a lot
But I still hate where I am
I need to get better a lot more quickly
I'm not sure what I should do
I've been watching the show Ballers
But motivating
American values, football, etc
Typical Dwayne Johnson show
HBO produced
BUt is about fighting your demons
It's kinda dumb
I want to do a 180
Everythibg
Okay
I'm sick of being socially awkward and insufficient
I'm usually the brunt of the joke
I hate that I was born like that
It happens in every friend group
It's not hostile bullying, but it is the group dynamic.
True
Yeah I'm not saying it's outside of my control
Hmm
True
It's hard to explain
It's more subtle than banter
I'm not saying you guys should change
I'm just saying the dynamic can slightly shift
Hmm yeah
That's true
Okay makes sense
Hmm that's true
That's really good feedback
That's a good question
Does your brain autistic shit post a lot?
BTW can you give me admin access to Arimooster? I want to show it to the intern
I wonder if everyone does it
That's true
I feel like my thoughts are kinda more ridiculous though
Or it's just insanity
Well that's obvious
Yeah that's obvious
That's true
IDK
I really should stop smoking
I think it enables me to be more autistic
And depressed
It wears away on social ability
Like I can't act socially on LSD
No not at all
But I gain a lot more social awarness
Like in social situations with LSD, I can gauge the social dynamic with uncanny ability
But I can't act appropriately
But makes me super introspective about self improvement
I had a really powerful trip yesterday
So just kinda be silent
I had an ego death
And swallowed me and my thoughts whole
Then I became friends with a the leafs and a piece of bark turned into a fury pet and cheered me on
It said "I'm rooting for you Ari!"
And I was imagined away into nothingness
The roots of tree became a trap
Hahahaha
Didn't even notice
But it was a bit later than that
And depressed
It's not what I need right now
And lethargic
Just makes you dumb
Anxiety
Inability to think coherently
Everything is different
On different neurologies
It just does
I think for many people it can
To escape from my problems
Being fuzzy headed
Still don't enjoy it
I'm not saying you shouldn't smoke
Or it's bad
I need to focus on self improvement and controlling my emotions
I don't think I have enough self control for moderation
And weed inhibits both of that
One thing at a time
I'll still drink because it doesn't inhibit me in the same way
Yeah
I think you underestimate how bad things got for me emotionally
Everyday I wake up and feel like lead
It takes a lot of will to get out of bed
Once I get to work is okay
Not finding meaning in life or work
Not feeling like I can be appreciated
Not improving as fast as I wanted
Probably from not getting promo
Also Nick said that he didn't believe I could really change
How did I get played at work?
Hmm
Hmm I see
Hmm that's true
But I also need self-fulfillment. I don't want to just be tolerated, I want to be loved.
Right
Tolerated is the first step
I just meant that's not like the only thing to do
I think maybe she feels guilty that the conversation died
I think you guys both like each other
Hahahahhaah
I'd keep the line open
But don't want to go forward because long distance
LOL that's true
Because don't really like her?
No
And let romance completely die
But don't over correct
Lol what did u say?
Y ignore?
That makes it weird
No
Hmm
That would be the easiest way out
But I think you need to deal with situations that are tough and get good at it
Not you specifically
Take her with some friends
Depends on how clean a break you want
Nah
Or you can tell her you're busy
See how she acts
If you wanna be done with her just cancel period
If wanna become friends then invite to blend
If she asks to get drinks afterwards, decline
Show her clearly it's platonic
Oh true
Then yeah cancel at blend
I agree
But the question remains
Do you want to be friends or nah?
Well it's clear then
If don't want to be friends just say you're busy right now at blend
Firm but polite
If wanna be friends, then just invite to group event
Sit on opposite of room
And settle on an exact date?
Hahah did you invite her to come?
Well she's gonna ask for a time?
It's just her intro to coming to blend
Then cut her the fuck off
Unless she pulls a Jenny and comes anyway
Yeah you should
So you just embrace it and go with it
Nah
Well that guy was gaslighting ber
Her
Like Katherine also was more vulnerable
But Peggy isn't being brae
Or be a bitch
He kinda pushed her into a corner
Where she had to humor him
So just reject that corner
Then let her down gently
Just like give her an opportunity to make a move
In terms of making her feel guilty for hanging with us
He also gaslighted her a bit
She shouldn't have lied
That's true
Nah
That means she < other friends
"we've decided to move forwards with other candidates"
???
Who did?
What?
Oh I see
Just tell her things are a bit hectic at work right now
And you don't have much time to show people around
Bai rui?
She's not that weird in person
So it was derpy
She made a dumb comment when I first met her
But noticed was repeated pattern
SHe was still all right looking
Yeah dodged a bullet
But I realized she's kinda dumb
Bai?
I'd put her at anqi level
I think she's > jacq
I disagree
I'd put her below
I don't think jacq is good looking
What?
Are they?
Proportions are off
Haha
Worse than Jing?
Hmmm
How does buy compare to Jacq in your opinion?
No I mean Jing
Compare to Jacq
She looks a bit childish
Her expresions are a bit muted
WHy do that?
Also gym when?
Singing class?
Singing af
Tell me funny stories about girls
Haha
https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~atwu/firstcultural/imagine-no-cars.html
Yes
LOL
And just stupied
Yeah
I also got confused
And then work backwards to this reality
I think it's both
Present a completely alternate reality
Just like work backwards
Maybe like Hagellian
Haha
Go durations are so dumb
Doesn't have a a Milliseconds() or Microseconds()
Yeah
BTW trip with James was really good actually
He can act like a dick but I realized he was a true friend
I mean he was endlessly supportive of me, comforting when I had dark moments, really showed a true care for all of his friends
I also think that part of him turned off
I know why
And shut down all brae stuff
I think he saw that I was in a vulnerable place
But I think it strips away people's true intentions
LSD brings out the best and the worst in people
People that have their best interests rooted in the happiness of their friends almost always drop their irritating behaviors
It forges irreparable bonds or breaks friendships apart
Because you don't realize it
You don't need it
That's good
But people develop so many defense mechanisms and fear and embarrassment.
I think I realized I'm not self-sufficient like that
Well I've suppressed so many emotions over the years
So I was dead and confused in the inside for a long time
Now that tripping and otherwise growing I've begun to relate to people
And it's the most wonderful thing I've ever experienced
I was never able to relate to people
It's a much more powerful experience than any thing I could ever create for myself
I like life like a roller coaster
I don't know
You get a flaming passion
Extreme sadness and extreme happiness
I know
🐮
Never again
No
But only once
I did
Yeah but long
It's horrifying
FOMO
FOMO
Wait 10pm
Eating
Okay
Fitness SF?
You said 10:05
Yeah
🐮
🐮
Gym at 7:30pm?
Just pushups?
LOLOLOL not really
Things are back to normal
Hahahaha
Fomo when?
True
🐮
Hmm
Add stephanie to Smoek?
Wait
That was another smoek group
Yeah exactly
I think that group could use less shitposting
What is that?
Got dinner plans
???
I don't remember discussing it
Oh I see
She doesn't have ID
Hannah
I know
She doesn't have an ID
Oh true
I see the chat
I can't technology
So kinda conflicts
She is available at 7:40pm
Depends on how long we chill
And how long you guys go out for
Lol
I am
I'm in your room
I have your spare key
But Ryan was sick
So he asked him to leave
Thank
*me to leavw
No fake chaima
Disintegrated
Fake chaima
Was unstable
It collapsed
Chaima is a singleton
Writing code?
Nah
Roobining is a monad
Do you like writing code?
No
Monad
Talking about st sheriff at all hands
Dude do you like coding?
Two truths and a lie
I've coded an Android app in Java
Yeah dude
I've had a whole town in Mexico look for me
I know a terrorist
Lol yep
Fuck
Somewhere in Baja California
Starts with a T
Tordes something
Haha
Better to trick him that u dated Jenn
🐮
Hmm should I move to NY?
Lease ends September 30
When lease ends?
Datadog?
Idk
4.6 on glassdoor
What makes a place optimal for that?
It's like working for mixed panel or interana
Like is blend good for your career?
Your metric I feel like was pay, intelligence and culture of people, and path to become a manager
Not as strict on that one though
Same except replace the manager with interesting technical challenges
I have 4 companies so far
What is your timeline?
I don't want to like sign a lease with Libbey and then brae
Like I can get company to pay the break lease fee
Docker, datadog, placeiq, phosphorus
And roobin said he's down at some poi
We can convince Libbey to come
Yeah just got like a lot of friends here now
But you and Libbey at this point are the only super strong ones
When's the office gonna be finished?
Ryan, Robin, Connie, and serge are also pretty good but less strong
LOL because Roobin never discusses deep shit with me
Emotional bond doesn't develop
Never talks about Jacq or anything like that
It's how I bond with someone
If I'm not vulnerable with them
I'd say the people here that I'm emotionally super close with is you, Libbey, and James
But James is leaving
I'm not saying I'm not good friends with him
Wouldn't miss as much
But it's a different level
Yeah but not the same level
Strangely, I also feel super close to Connie
With me, close friendships are quausy romantic
That's on a more deep and substantial level than the fun and entertainment I get
That's what I first noticed about you
Like it resonates on a deep emotional level
When I started at Uber
And I get an inherent happiness and joy just by virtue of being with them
I noticed you liked to hang out with people who were entertaining
Since you were so much cooler than me, I was like "why is this guy always down to hang out?"
Versus with Libbey it was pretty instant
Yeah
And I was like probably just because he thinks I'm hella entertaining
That's why it took a long time to get to that level with you
I think in this situation you're actually the exception
Chain when
🐮
Pretty good
Not good at lanesplitting though
You still drinking?
Wait
Nah
Haha
Vin
Panic
Yes
Jasontellquick
Oh god
That's such a hack
Commit this
Lol
🐮
🐮
Lol
Said the stone ages called, they want their Christians back
Saw some pp protestors today
Planned Parenthood protestors
People were too progressive back then
True
Hahaha
Good one
Now
Another attractive thing about NYC is ease of university part time
They are right there
45 mins for each
Not right there
Haha
How is?
Thank
I stole
Chaima
Now
Why? You're in Vegas
Gonna club tonight?
Wow
Hahaha
I ride 95-100mph on freeway now
🐮
🐮
At brewery in Ukiah
Right now
🐮
It expires 9/9
Giving perception that it's more imminent
But sssh
Lol
Idk
Give him shit for braeing on plans
So just act like he agreed
It says no
Libbey
Maybe he'll forget he didn't agree to come
It would only work for him
I know
Haha
Club took it?
Lol so fail
Ordered an extra box of sushi by mistake
$24
Want some?
Trying to sell it off
Or can sell you 1/2
Fuck this
This is one of those days that sucker punches you in the balls
Maybe I should sucker punch Taz in the balls
Don't ever be like her if you become a manager
Why is she such a bitch>?
I hate her
Yeah exactly
She ridicules people a lot in the all hands
Well she's pretty mean
Not ready yet
I message when ready
No one
Come over soon
Yeah but ready yet
15-20 mins
🐮
10 mins
I'm going to buy an international SIM - I wanted to immerse myself in the natural world, but I'm a bit of a cheetah
Np
Let me know how it goes
Fomo
Wait why not like the companies I listed?
Don't you think DO could be fun?
But they are a fantastic document store for analytics and short term storage needs
Also mongodb is not good for persistent storage, and I agree they shouldn't mascquerad as a replacement for an ACID storage solution
I want to help the web scale
What about mongo?
I don't think I am?
Is it?
I feel like I did
Washed up?
Phosphorus
Spotify
They are computational genomics
Datadog
Digital Ocean
Phosphorus
flatiron
NS1
mongodb


senior openings
----------------
opentrons
clarifai
stash
Genomics platform for cancer research
Could be a bit fun to code carefully
Like a well written rule fewmework wouldn't work
Yeah
That's true
So many edge cases
Rules don't make sense
Yeah exactly
So I feel like I'd be happy with Spotify, DO, phosphorus, or flatiron
By being happy I mean being excited
Right I don't feel like I'd be settling with any of these
Is blend?
So like blend has a good future
Like not much opportunities for technical growth
Versus if I join one of thesw
But kinda boring
Even if it isn't the next big thing
I still learn a shit ton
Tell her
"I can barely jungle all the food choices I have!"
"I really am having trouble deciding what to eat for desert"
Lolol
But isn't genomics pretty cool?
Why? Big data
Consistently difficult engineering problems
Big data is super fun
Ah
Right so like using spark and shit is really fun
Has PLC aspects because you use formalisms to help reason about it
Complex in terms of understanding execution models
Doing it makes you think about things in different ways
It's like solving a math problem
CRUD is not like that
Aren't you doing CRUD?
But how is it not CRUD?
But like big data you're always thinking of distributed systems and the math behind it
Oh okay
Yeah don't really care about product
Because it's kinda subjective
If you lose an engineering argument, you learn something new
If you lose product argument,you just don't get your way
Distributed systems is a lot more pure
But often times can be political
But like directors don't really interfere in whether or how you use spark or samza or hadoop
Sometimes
How many?
Like and how interesting?
If it was like los Alamos
You get to be part of history
Then sure
What think?
https://www.google.com/amp/s/thelastdriverlicenseholder.com/2017/06/16/jingchi-corp-becomes-34th-company-with-californian-self-driving-license/amp/
What think though?
Never scheduled
He never replied
That's what Jenny called me
Where?
And why not with friends?
Which airport?
Hahaha
Haha who going with?
Oh just you too!
Take a pic of you guys making out in front of a lion
Nah
She isn't a girl 100% of the time
That's why I sometimes wonder if my brain processes things differently than most people
I don't know
Is that the case? So everyone gets weird thoughts?
Okay
Hmmm
Why eating African food before you get to Africa?
Oh nice
But not really in Africa before you leave airport?
Oh I see
Wait why?
It was just normal sex
🐮
SO restaurant
Now hanging with roucis
Check group chat
True
Make the rpm 8000-9000
Maybe just don't upshift as aggressively
That's true
Maybe I'm just not exploiting it enough
Hmm yeah that's what I'm thinking
That's amazing
You mean a lion pride?
And wtf
Wos
Wow
I'm not gonna be eating them
Sure
🐮
So girls are so TMI af
No
The 70 year old woman was talking about this one guy who was doing BDSM in this house next store
He left her in the driveway for a few days
Newspaper boy saw her and called the cops
With a rope
She fell to her death
The rope broke
And his wife was hanging out of the window
Yeah
The women was talking about how in Cleveland there was a lot of BDSM movements in the 60s
Just as crazy as San Francisco
Yeah
Monday
So anyway
This street
Yeah i get home at 9am
I was like TMI
But yeah back in the 60s Cleveland was still in the top 10 cities in the US
But she was like "yeah I never got into BDSM myself "
Would your parents ever bring up sex?
So they weren't against teenage sex
Haha
Oh
Me neither
Haha
So they were?
🐮
I'm in Cleveland until Monday morning
On Monday we should hang at your place
Charlie's GF is there
That's funny
But don't mind doing stuff in Cleveland instead
I have 0 fomo
Wait really?
Would be fun
Like I'd like to go out with Libbey and Katherine etc
Libbey is my best friend
Libbey and Katherine?
*one of
Wow watching now
🐮
I invite?
There's chill girl Nancy cai from aki's party
🐮
Too late
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
So if you meet her tonight, then you invite to bonfire
Haha
No clue
🐮
I'm not smoking though
Haha
She didn't reply
Yet
Where get dinner?
Sounds good
I'm just gonna give you gummies
BTW did you get my message where I said my place isn't available?
Cause Charlie needs spare key for Hannah
Yeah :(
Dang
Unless Hannah flight is delayed
Hmmm
Oooh
I feel digusting
Yeah
Right now
No time to shower for Sprint planning
Yaaas
Polar bears?
How long in lounge?
Same
Actually nah close to 30 hours
Nah actually got up late
But haven't showered for much less
Jason can I have bonfire persmissions?
Also Nancy and Katie can't make it
My room is also available
Work
Call me when in lobby
Nancy and Catie
Girl that goes everywhere with her
Good question
Also can you give me hosting privilege on bonfire?
But androgenous
Idk
Might be bff or dating
Fuck
So weird
Guilt trip af
This convo makes no sense
Haha
Your mom was on her way last night
Yeah too busy right now
Just ping when here
I don't care when
Got no more meetings
Kk
🐮
🐮
🐮
rude
Might bring friend to dinner
??
I take that as a yes or no?
Lol
Jessica ma
Oh
https://www.facebook.com/jessica.maleki
Idk
Idk
🐮
Idk
Could use sushi
I was thinking maybe eats
Who?
And nae about what?
Nae about Uber eats or nae about inviting Jessica
Oh she is Uber employee
Dude fuck this
Uber eats or restaurant?
Answer now
Useless
Kk
If don't answer by 7:15, I order eats
Okay
Leaving soon
🐮
We do different restaurants
Wait why?
What?
I order thay
Just send screenshot
Coming soon
I do sushi
Oh 17%?
Send screenshot
Kk
🐮
Done
Lol
I didn't like her that much
The one in our car?
There was a few
You know me and names
No
Are you staying at Ava?
Now is $4300/month
Bad neighborhood
And meet neighbors
$3999
I hate it
Because I like to take walks
I just hate the trash
The noise
The fifth
The vagrants
I just wanna live in a nice area
Not Civic center
Nob Hill
Adams point
I'm not gonna pay $4300/month to live in Civic center
Fidi
Adams point is north of lake Merritt
Proximity doesn't matter within some bounds
Proximity matters if it takes a long time to hangout
Oakland is 20 min
South Bay
Berkeley
Sunset is farther
Berkeley is 40 min
Felby is a better example
She's in the city all the time
True but that's for exogenous reasons
Either way, I'm not gonna pay more than $4k a month and I want my own bathroom
But not under $4k a month
And Civic center is discounted
We weren't that close friends
Roobin hangs out all the time...
The dog is ruined
So puppy is a lot of work
And if you don't put in the right amount
I'd give yourself 4-5
A lot
And with puppy is very slow
Cause have to train them to walk next to you
Taking them for walks will take forever
Before work and after work
2x per day
Yeah
Consistency is key
You can but the dog will be bothered by it
Dogs hate change
Yeah but you hold it that long when you sleep
So walking a puppy takes awhile
Cause have to walk them far
No
You should try to only make that period 7 hours or less
Those are expensive
And sometimes take them to dog school
But the training is 24/7
Yeah
You have to stop
Walking them they pull ahead
Etc
Not to eat from the counter
Say "heel"!
I'm okay
Clickers are a good technique
Depends
Pavlov af
Golden retrievers are good
Training dogs is all about behaviorism
Secondary conditioning
Playing fetch
6 months - 1 year
But most of the training is first 6 months
Just walking them
So like 2-3 hrs
You just need to drive them to a lake or field
Play fetch
Tire them out
Golden's will do that
You have to train them to only use their toys
Initially
So crate training is good
They don't mind
It's their "den"
Then they won't fuck things up when you're away
During the night and when you're away they just chill in a cage
Yeah
🐮
Too late
🐮
I feel like sex might be scarier if dude
Lol
Cause pressure to perform
Well if super hot girl can just lay there
Nah
Yeah true
BTW Stephanie's bf is inviting to her company
Yes
Verkada
I tell later
Not over messenger
Is stealth
Good publicity
Lol sure
Yes
🐮
Lol
Wanna talk companies
For a little bit
Come over tonight
Sounds good
Why her roommate?
Idc when
Why do you know her roommate?
O
🐮
Lol wait ETA?
Where?
Wait don't come tonight
I go to sleep
🐮
Is chaima ever not surreal?
Psychedelic
Haha
Yes
More like morph
Right now?
Be up until 3am?
I wish I had a shroom source
Same
Is more wholesome trip
LSD makes you think way too much and everything morphs and is a bit creepy
Okay here's how to look at it
A dog is a dog
But the skin and services all crawl and morph
A tree is a tree
So like the trees suddenly look like a bunch of people
Etc
Shrooms is macroscopic
And do weird things
Lsd hallucinations are microscopic
You know how in childhood you had that feeling that everything was adventure
And you could easily imagine anything
Felt like I was on another planet
That's shrooms
Or that the trees were a group of people
Exploring alien life
But not much
Macrosopic
The services of things moved a little
I had to be alone in the forest to really experience it
So with distractions easy to ignore
Also shrooms we had were weak af
Standing still with them makes things normal
Or walking around
Also LSD feels like everything changes and is distorted
Mushrooms make it seem like it existed all along and you were just tuned to the wrong channel
I'm sure having more would make it more impactful
Like you changed
But maybe it was there too
Btw that's how I justify people feeling like they have a spiritual experience from a drug
Like it is induced
It just tunes it to the right wave length
And the drug doesn't produce it
Haha
Have I shit posted lately in a group?
I did that a lot in 2016
Was this recent?
Oh who? Katherine?
I don't think I do
So if I do I need to know ASAP
Wait why?
Idk
Never had a meaningful conversation with her
🐮
Lol haha
Wow
High school classmate
Trying to build a modeling career
That's why she's modeling I suppose
Real reason Katherine doesn't come to restaurants
Hmmm
Is she doesn't eat in public
Or anything in public
Chyll
Junior sesig though
He's 28 dude
Still needa
Not growing
Or 27 actually
Nah
Nah
Some girls like
Not really
Thank
Good
He's not
Yeah
Loves
Uses a lot of monadT
That stands for monad transformers
Idk
But you use those in soa
You wrap a future in an either T
Rpc calls
Scala
It's compiled
Then why is it compiled?
Nah Scala doesn't run in the jvm
Versus Python is just in time compiled
At run time
Scala, unlike Java, is compiled into bytecode
No Java is interepreted
Scala is ahead of time compilation
But wait
I'm just kidding
I know
Then compiled into binary via JIT
No
I thought it was compiled into byte code ahead of time
Why not ahead of time
Why need to JIT then?
So different computers will generate different byte codes, right?
If in VM?
Okay
That's what I said
Roobin
Oh I never meant that
Fuck
When does it arrive?
Yes
This is why moto
Just use wrench
Your mom wasn't hard to do
Lol nice
Did bmw realize new motorcycles too?
Release
Slacked off so much
Yeah
8pm
Gotta practice
Mad at myself
Thank
🐮
But why is issue? There's a Safeway right there
Yeah sure
Oh I see
Yeah
I might Moto over
Wanna smoke?
Fuck my Go debugger refuses to display string values
No as an opener
Is weird
Just shows pointers
Say how you're interested in getting one
She sounds a like she has a hidden bitch
You could always talk dogs
What type of dogs do you like? I'm considering buying an ___
Would you ever live in Chile?
Only developed country in latam
It's developing
BraIl isn't developed
They are the only country in Latam to have the developed status
Oh nice!!!!
Nice!!
Startup
Kinda sounds fun to join company where there's no ladder to climb
How?
Right I'm not talking about blend
I don't consider that really a startup
It's a growing company with a lot of potential
You manage friendships a bit
You are fairly political
Like when you plan events you choose group composition pretty carefully
You have a reputation of being super friendly but also super managy about it
So in NYC wouldn't manage?
🐮
But omg
So funny
Everyone that knows me has this disorder
Jenny af
Height?
You think she's so bitter cause of her hei?
What?
??
Jason
FOMO
Jason
Why is Bert lost?
Ugh trying to find word path
Jason
Practicing
🐮
Emptional empathy?
Well therapists are good at breaking down your true incentives
Lol
Do you think emotionally you're more similar to them or me?
It's like a hidden Markov model
Hmm but think that might have to do with age?
Did I say I didn't want to hang with serge ever?
Right but I mean better control than md
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Maybe not tonight
I will see
Also stuck here
Yeah
Drank two beers so can't leave right now
I'm reading tales of the city
A bit girly but pretty good
A fiction about San Francisco in the 1970s
That's what I'm doing
It's about a girl who move to SF from Cleveland
Lol
It's a classic primer for living here
Even when it was super big
But not cosmopolitan
Cleveland never really had a metropolitan feel
No transients
Etc
Everyone knew each other
Very entrepreneurial
And great music and theater scene
Like it was a place where you could make a shit ton of money
Or weirdos
In maybe an hour
🐮
Not home yet though
Yeah
Already changed man
Not gonna renew
Fine I go soon
Btw my card expires 9/10
Don't wanna smoke anymore
Eating right now
Tipped her
Nah
Lol I'm not gonna charge you
That would be so brae
lol
It's just imitating your sex life
Prank
no
Jason are you watching?
Haha
Filip's company is pretty stacked
http://www.verkada.com
Yeah
Wait why are we meeting at blend?
Is this the color factory?
Worth?
Want to do Stephanie bf project
BTW why meet at Blend?
LOL kk
Wow
BGC just had the most autistic intro
I live in Bothell downtown with my family. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling with 4 year old daughter and explore the food around world. Not everyone says I'm an out going person, however, I do enjoy making friends with people around the world.
Not everyone says I am outgoing
I was hanging with Ernie yesterday
What?
Bert's best friend
Wait does blend have beer?
Bert af
MMJ doctor is the place
Either way
Door to door
My walk on Saturday afternoon took 1 hr
Give yourself about an hour
Go to mmj doctor
Can you describe what makes you insomniac?
Well it helps if it's true
Bring $100 (or they have an atm)
Well are you anxious
What keeps you up?
Bring your drivers license
Say you worry about work
And think of some problem you have
Well you don't pay unless you are prescribed a card
It doesn't have to be convincing
So what do you think?
But he's not gonna second guess you
You just need to provide a comprehensive story
The doctor wants to give you a card
So he kinda needs like a reason
But it has to be complete
But at the same time, he doesn't want to lose his license
Right
And won't fill in the details for you
But he needs a reason in the record
Like he knows it's bullshit
Yeah
That has only an 80% chance of workinhg
Hahaha
That is me right now
Yeah exactly
For me didn't get it initially either
Like what do you do?
That person will never want to talk to me again
Second guess your life choices?
I think like if I had weird social interaction
You don't second guess?
Oh micro things
Oh hmm
Haha hmm yeah
Things out of your control though
Yeah
So not macro
Oh I see
Same with acid
Similar train of thoughts happen with a bad acid trip
And the tree grew and trapped me
Acid is similar but the visuals accompany it
Once I was like "my life is a trap"
But the reality was the metaphor
Oh interesting
Oh really?
Hmm
Yeah
Like we were with each other so could distract each otber
But no thought loops
Lsd you can
With pot you don't have thought loops
Haha yeah that's psychedelics
Hmm I can try
Still convenient
And tomorrow
Yeah
Okay but I'm busy for the next few days
If you're actually gonna get stoned just spend money on the real deal
Get a pax
If you want, just pop into mmj doctor before work
Tomorrow
Do it tomorrow
Don't be a stoner about getting your card
Oh true
I mean Libbey is down
But I don't need weed to shitpost
Lol
I'm not down to smoke
Are we smoking?
The architecture one?
Read what?
Or just get distracted
Do you like actually read slowly?
Hmm
Also for a book like that you want to process it
It's helpful to me
Which I find boring
But not boring
Right but I always want to get full autistic
It's breadth over depth
Not like fiction where you just read
That's because that book isn't too interesting
Hmm
This is an interesting question
I don't like my personality
I mean that book is a bit out of date wrt to big data
I like girls who are super smooth
That's what is appealing about girls like felby or jackie
Oh
Like not awkward or stuttering
Remember that girl in Cuba?
I just passed him and he said yes
The Austrian one? Who got us into that club?
She's the epitome
No it was the night you went. Then everyone immediately went home
But like her
Her personality type
Jing was inside it
Yeah
Would have been good af fuck though
Jing af
But not in bed. Besides holding out
Why not just be upfront?
I know
Yeah she is
She also didn't like to sleep in bed together
Which is fair
It was obviously cause she was afraid of getting attached
Yeah
Or people who love to get hammered but then don't smoke
Those are only two
Only reason for that is 1) don't like weed or 2) worried about getting drug tested
But a lot of people say "I don't do drugs!!!"
Oh but vaping isn't it
So is drinking
Same with drinking
But 6) is true
Right but I wouldn't trust myself to behave well high
I always felt normal drinking at work
It's weird about that
But would never smoke
If you were willing to cross the barrier to smoke weed, you might also do it in the event of molly
Hmm I see
The question about weed being a gateway drug is a bit interesting
And Michelle takes out her molly
Like one day let's say you've never smoked
And then you go to edc
Would you not do?
Because I associated weed with something the stoners did
I always wanted to try LSD way before weed
Versus lsd sounded super exciting
I think lsd has had permanent effects on me
That's true
Lsd doesn't change your awarness
In a way more than lsd
That's true
Versus alcohol getting that drunk gives you poisoning
Oh I see
I see
That's true
Yeah
I can't pay attention
Yeah
It also produces a lot of racing thoughts
That doesn't work for me
Yeah
I had some trouble with that
Remember I was dumb af
As I was high
You had it processed?
But by the time you showed it to me
You explained it to me a bunch
Or did you have to pause it a lot
Yeah same
But my brain dies with weed
That's lsd for me
But the effects are more cosmic
With lsd it races
Yeah, it's more than that
I can get demoralized and existential doubt
Suddenly I can see things from any person's perspective
I feel a connection with everything
Intellectually, physically, morally
It's the exact opposite of autism
So the universe having a connected, beautiful symmetry is inspiring
It showed me how to get over anger and take responsibility
Hahaha
No 8pm
Sure. Leaving soon though?
Walking out
Get joints
🐮
I'm in NYC
Cool
???
Tonight?
Oh wanna make clams?
Tomorrow night might have date
Tonight is the only night this week I can do it fod
For
Friday I'm flying to NYC
What's the difference?
I'm not hungry rn
No def ask Ryan
Oh that's fine
Answer what?
So I charge double
Accidentally
What?
ETA?
Would Albert be down?
At least not always during work hours
We gotta make crabs now
They are alive
No dude
Yes
September 30
No
When is foundry?
Huh
Have 3 credits saved
3 floats
1 hr
I can sell you one for $50
What was the ocean song Katherine played?
By who?
🐮
Now
Was like different person
He was a bit rejected and super awkward
Wow Jake changed a lot
He wanted to call
Mustaches are on my utility stand
Yellow envelope
You'll fomo
No
Haha
No he wants to send me more companies
Should I ask him to come chill?
Just to fuck with him?
But should I ask Jake to chill?
At my apartment?
Come over and smoke
Or have a beer
?
For fun
What?
Lol what was it about?
Wait keep going but you can take both crabs
So cute when they do that
Oh nice
Actually don't take unless Charlie doesn't want
Haha
Wish I could do
Wow
Lsd during acid rain?
https://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/2017/09-03.html
Labor day
Is she cute?
How compare to Jing?
So hard to tell
🐮
Better than BART
Late start
Got up late
What?
Thought was gonna go to country club with Uncle
Hanging with kon later
But has serious personality flaws
He is fun
I still think he's a good person
I feel like if he resolves those he'd be golden
I'm in Harlem right now
It's actually still fairly hood
Doesn't feel dangerous though
And apologized profusely
I was mad after that night
But he bought me lunch
But he apologized afterwards
Like if this was every time we went out I wouldn't be down
And it was his birthday
So considering that, it's not unforgivable
Not that that makes it okay
I got a story
<3
You still up?
Didn't know anyone there
So was at this bar
Light was dim
So read book
I was a bit awkward
After that someone pulled her away
We talked
This cute asian girl came over and shined flashlight on book
Was like "you can read in this light? Why you reading in a bar?"
But her friend came over
I was like "she's cute, only met her 3 minutes ago"
But then guy friend was like "let's go" to the group
She seems more interested
Also cute af
Keeps pretending to like the book
We chat
Was like "do you like her?"
She starts talking
And they left
If you can get that much for reading a book, guess what you can get if you actually put in effort
Then she came back but was like "I'm just using the restroom. Nice knowing you! Sorry it was so breif"
Patted me on the waste on the way out
*waist
So rachet
Also while I was walking to the bar, a drunk girl randomly passed me and slapped my ass
🐮
🐮
Lol I know
🐮
At least SF has bison
NYC has no cows
Moo
And if you even try to cut off convo cause not interested
They aren't like desperate or salty
But when you approach them they are super friendly
Wow so girls in NYC are like ideal
Always down to talk
They try to keep it going
???
Interview
🐮
🐮
🐮
So stupid
Wtf
You can't just ask each person what eye color they have?
How could you possibly screw this up?
Either way do you know the pecentage
Or different for each guard?
Is the percentage constant?
Can you ask a guard again and again and the answer might be different?
Well you can easily calculate probability for each guard
But not probability of right or wrong
Oh true
So then you ask them how ever many times it and find the person who has yes in the truth distribution
Tuesday night
11:30pm
Idk
Yeah
Do you need a loan?
Oh true
???
🐮
Yaaa
Thanks dude
So one question the guy gave a slight hint
Other interviews I feel okay about
But didn't do the best defending
And poked problems in the code that weren't there
Wasn't ever stumped
Still got solution super early though
Yeah
But career discussion kind of awk
Solved problem instantly
OSM
IPO
I don't know how soft one went
N queens
Usually asked 2 questions during interview
First interview they asked me to find sorted subarrays
The n queens one was just one
I'm not sure if there was supposed to be another one
Like if [1,3,4,1,2]
Return [[1,3,4],[1,2]]
Then the next question they asked was flatten this back into sorted array
Yeah exactly
That's what I did
Also the career guy didn't know what a dag was
Then Saturday night is good
It's only like 2:45
If felby isn't down to go anyway
Yeah
I'm down to go with one person
I mean
Yeah
It isn't ideal
I have all the stuff now
So...
Be home in 30

Yaaas
Fine
Since you said vote
Oh btw hows blend in NYC looking?
Okay
Nevermind
This convo
When will have?
Did you check out East village in nyc?
Maybe h1?
It's like half way between midtown and downtown
Tons of bars
But has lots of trees
Very homey
Super close to everything
So very close to thinga
East village
Very quiey
Can even hear crickets at night lol
I think NYC has some places that feel like "fuck off I'm a big city and you're an ant. Proceed at your own risk"
Midtown has that feel
Wall St has that feel
Feels so artificial
But easy village feels like nob hill
Why?
And quiey
You know how nob Hill is very small and cozy
Well fidi in NYC has nothing going on late
But it looks more homey
Easy village is where you go drinking
But lots of bars everywhere
What think of this neighborhood?
Wall St is too claustrophobic
I like because is quiet
But fidi isn't homey
You don't want to feel part of the neighborhood?
I like to be able to take walks
Yeah we look for different things
Because Polk is in nob Hill
But easy village would still meet your criteria
Yeah that's east village
Yeah East village doesn't have many of those
Cause nob Hill is homey
But if you find a high rise, East village will have the best view
Yeah I'd want house in the hills
Lol this is so unrealistic in so many ways
Oh I see
What time is board games tomorrow?
Okay
You know you have to code to complete your Sprint?
Lol
O say
I can't be offended
No say
