When you throw non real numbers into problems usually done with reals
That's a good way of modeling quantum behavior
Hmmm
I'm bullshitting
There's rumors about something related to Uber
Something big
Takes a year lol
But like not exactly an IPO
I tell tonight
Did you say that to her?
Yeah
That's reasonable
Because he might see you and think you're just doing your plate
So he's like making sure you do the whole thing
Oh
My mom did something kinda similar
But she would justify things after I agreed
"can you clean up the living room?"
"sure Mom"
"it's just that I'm super stressed out right now and can't keep doing everything myself"
Guilt tripping is only useful when someone doesn't want to do something
Now I feel guilty and shitty and I was gonna do it anyway
Yeah
What think?
😠

No
The time cube doesn't rotate
Earth rotates within the timecube
Really?
Why does Ryan ignore?
Won't trust me but believes in invisible Man in the sky
Every Sunday he gets up early and goes to this big room
He listens to some decrepit old backwards guy
Talk about man walking on water
Guy splitting the sea
A psychopathic god
He sings music that has less rhythmic ingenuity than twinkle twinkle Little star
He sings about how he likes being controlled by an entity more angry, more arbitrary, and more backwards than he
He likes to visualize this guy watching his every move every day
Every girl he fucks
Every shower he takes he imagine this guy watching and recording him
Is Pandora bar 21+?
Same person
But she's 20
So probably can't
Only reason wanted to with Ryan's event was because she leaves soon
Lol true
It just kinda feels shitty to not ever be able to bring my own friend to events
So like I can't ever bring friends ever to an event?
What does "these events" mean?
Yeah not saying he isn't
Oh okay
I agree I went overboard with the Ryan event
I thought you mean that I can't bring friends to events in general that you and Ryan host
"just hang out with her then
like not to these events"
I thought you mean like "you can hang with your friends but don't invite them to events me and Ryan generally host/organize"
Right I'm not saying asking is unreasonable
I thought you were categorically saying "Don't bring your friends to the events I organize"
Of course you should always ask
Oh okay
LOL true
But you DID invite her to oysters
Now I'm kinda mad about it
That I have to deal with tomorrow
Me
She will follow me around
LOL
IDK that's true
True
Yeah
Oh BTW
Did you ever check if Stephanie liked her?
Because when she left she was like "I think Stephanie was super impressed with me"
Oh hmm
When back?
Maybe I invite Hannah then
3 weeks
Hannah
var stack = new Stack()
l = len(name)
index = 0;
while index < len / 2 {
stack.push(name[index])
}
Nevermind
I can do this in place
LOL
No lol
How is that solving it?
Oh I was implementing isPalandrome()
I love how we both thought of the same thing
No
This will work with hannha
Nice
Gracefully handles differences between even and odd
Yeag
Yaeg
It's me
Costoco when?
FOMO
Nah
NO it doesn't.
That's how to not make breaking changes
For the request schema, you can't go required -> optional
For the response schema, you can't optional -> require
Think about it this way:
If you add a parameter that is actually required but mark it optional, your code will just break your service
So you'll return a 500 instead of a 400
If it's not actually required by your code it should have never been required in the first place
LOL okay sure
When is he coming?
Okay coming
Is Jenny still there?
Or did she go back to LA?
Jenny af
NOOOO
Now some random girl in socal is gonna think I'm weird af
Or you bought them
Okay coming
This book is bullshit
It is end-to-end ready
Thrift you slap over HTTP
It allows you to use HTTP like an RPC
Protobufs is actually an SOA system designed from the ground up
It's analogous to the tchannel+hyperbahn+thrift suite of software
The difference is that it actually works really well. And it's really, really fast.
Ok
JUL 15TH, 8:31AMYeah in like 5 mins
Do I need to buy?
Okay
KKathy
Doing now
Shabou
Shabou called you.
July 15th, 1:02pm
Call Again
JUL 16TH, 12:04PMOh no
Hahaha
???
So confused
Oh he said it wouldn't work
Yeah
He had a conflict
Then no mushrooms?
That is a lot if people tho
Hmmm
What about shrooms though?
But if we do shrooms then they do acid the timing will be off
Ok
Hmmm
4 people is a lot for acid tho
Lol I guess is fine
If acid works it can be a very deep emotional experience
It's important for there to be complete trust and confidence
Yeah but on a deep level I'm comfortable with him
Hmmm
You need to let down your barriers and say whatever is on your mind without fear of being judged
What frustrated you?
Yeah. Did you just go with it or were you trying to fight it?
Hmmm
Problem is we hit the deepest part in a sushi shop
And it was relatively weak
Do you trust Alex?
Ah. I don't
I am deeply suspicious of most people
And Alex?
Ok
But like this trip I might wander away at times
Yeah
Hmm
I'm gonna ride through Oakland hills
And see if there's a good spot
Nah
You won't things with complex geometric patterns
*want
Yeah
That's the other problem with beaches
Hmm that's true
I prefer feeling secluded
We talked too much last time
Yeah that was brae
True
Sorry about that
What?
About how he's being thirsty a
AF?
What about it?
Haha. Found the third mushroom
About
Haha
Hmm
When coming?
About to go moto
If you can be back by 3pm, we can do
So then it's a yes?
Okau
Sounds good
Gg park?
Like we meet at Ava
Then go
Hot
But gg park is cooler
80s
Okay
Okay
I don't want him to babysit tho
I talked to Alex
Wait what doing? Why texting?
Are parents driving?
It's a head high
More visual
Less visual
I mean
More deepEta?
Come
Have we made plans for dinner yet?
Lol wanna chill tho?
I'm also down to just Uber eats
Time for more sushi
I'm not back yet
I mean in like an hour
SUN 9:10PMUber eats delivery is gonna get here before I do
Mine getting it?
*mind?
Heading back right nowFront
Yeah
Oh shit
It's laskie
Shabou
Shabou called you.
Call Again
He's going back to the front
Right in front
Hmmm should I call?Wait
I'm about to be here
Okay
Where is towel?
And thanks so much for getting
Okay
Thanks
SUN 10:36PMTinyWell you got a week to decide
It was mild
Hmmm
After I wandered around
Felt like I was wandering through a magical forest
I walked around the ocean
Yeah that's why I went for a walk
Felt like I was wondering through a beautiful garden
Yeah same
That's why need to be walking in nature
Yeah man it was magical
I only enjoyed after you left
That would be bad
Haha. I only felt good after you left
Not because you left
That's just when it hit me
??

Super interesting essay on the history of mushrooms
Published in 1957
Sorry, that link didn't work
here's the real one: http://www.psychedelic-library.org/life.htm
30.00
For
oysters
Status
What is wrong with this sentence: I am growing a mushroom plant?
We can split
Okay mushrooms aren't a plant
PLant means photosynthesis
It's interesting because mushrooms return matter and nutrients to the soil
And LSD and shrooms, both fungi, return people back to nature
Yeah agreed
I've been doing pottery
And stuff
Soma arts center
Few blocks away from ava
Doing tonight
Come?
$0
Is every Monday
Idk I'll ask
But probably just Monday
Btw most people get nervous about tripping
But the visions produce a euphoria
That distracts from the underlying unease
If I trip this Sunday, gonna do two tabs
But if just Jason
Then I won't do
Same reasons you mentioned
But if you actually are tripping
Don't want to talk that often
Yeah true
It's hard because I don't want to talk to people most of the time
Because you need to be quiet to kick in
But sometimes you can freak out
So need friends there
Natives were very careful about how they used them
Ture
The rituals built around using psychedelics makes them magical but comforting
What is?
Tooth containers?
Haha
Love it
Do you prefer urban jungle?
Or nice but dense parts of city
Like would you like wall street area
Or like upper west side?
Sure
So this is upper west side
Still plenty of things to do
But more stately
Maybe
But I feel like it will be hipster driven
Upper west side was gradually built over many years
So feels grand and stately
That's why I like Paris
Super old, stately
But dense
Lots to do
What think?
Israel also has housing crisis
That's probably what's preventing peace with Palestinians tbh
Fuck
I need to cram Sipser
My team wants to implement a DFA
https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X
Yes
Should we add our separate friends to the chat?
LOL work friends
Oh true.
Group chat is better for real-time chat
When actually on the event or night before
FB event is good for persistent details
True
True
Thanks for the help
I still take responsibility for all the planning, but made you co-host so you can invite people and change shit
Tank
You waved at Ari!
You and Ari waved at each other!
What is chaima salary?
What
Yeah but not divulging info online
i tell in person
not quiet
yes
ooooh
how recently?
lol
why did he forfeit stocks?
so dumb
???
Not leave
Was probably like $2 million?
At least one million
$5 million?
Yeah you can probably get loans
Try to sell on secondary market
Anything but sell them!!!
A sure bet of how much money?
That's a false dichotomy. Not only would waiting be a better compromise between money and opportunity, it also allows more meaning
Like that didn't work out
So now he has to go back to a boring job at flexport
Whereas if he was rich af, he could just afford to start something else
Ah
Sounded pretty boring tbh
It was for mgmt, right?
Will taz retaliate?Hmm okay
How does Blend do perf?
Maybe they just Blend the entire team together
Everyone arimoosters.
TUE 11:08PMHe kinda invited himself
He's going back to Minnesota though
Lol yeah it is my event
But I mostly decided it didn't matter cause you weren't coming and Jason Libbey was for it
True
I didn't!
I know!
True
Oh good
Oh god
Imagine tripping with Jenny
The difference is that James isn't as self absorbed
He does like to brag and show off
But he doesn't always just redirect the convo to himself
Hmm
They both are a bit unsettling
BTW Redux is actually just a state monad
YeahLiang is pretty down
Let me check
Yeah will do
Yeah sure
Jacq?
Not angry at her anymore
Haha girl scouts don't camp
BTW are you gonna message anqi and jacq?
Cause anqi hates me
No
Just assume all of Jacq's friends hate me
True
No one except for Jason and Connie liked Jenny
haha I messaged Vicki
I think Jenny was well behaved the night she met Connie
And she's not as bad 1:1
Cause like half of the reason she's brae is because she chooses shit conversation topics
But what really makes people HATE her is when 1. they are against the flow of the conversation 2. when the conversation doesn't change to flow in the direction of the topics no one else wants to talk about, she individually tries to divide the conversation participants by engaging them individually.
2. is the really brae one. She did it to me when we were dating all the time but I just thought it was because we were dating
Like still brae
But girls sometimes do that
And was just gonna take her up on it later
But like didn't realize she did it to everyone
Yeah Angie does it a lot
But not as fiercely as Jenny
Yeah same
And the topics she does it with aren't bad though
Yeah same
Damn
HmmBook 1 night or 2 nights?
It has a shower facility
No it doesn't.
But nearby
Liang's friend
Why did I invite Jing camping?
Liang = Jing
Looks wise
Eh
Can't say about yichen
No
Liang is fobby in the sense that she's a bit quiet and speaks in a Chinese accent
She's quiet
But not anti social
Participates in conversations and stuff
Just doesn't always contribute the most
Like she's nods and reacts and occasionally pipes in
But isn't like super loud
Haha
Nah
Xiaowei?
Yeah true. Hmm, maybe Austin level
Like not social skills of Austin
Frequency of him
Or bin
Dude it's like 2 months from now
Wanna go before then?
Oh dude
Where?
Lol down for that
But gonna go camping in two weeks
Just me
Why not? Get to hang around on the wilderness
Go swimming
Oh hmmm
No not
Like he's not the guy who wouldn
't consider it and maybe experiment a little
He's a curious and adventurous person
But like I don't think he is any less straight than the rest of us
I told you before that I'm not completely straight
But still not down to try it
Yeah
Question is
Am I a bit bi? Or are you just like super straight?
That's the question
I'm like a 7 or 7.5
Oh then I'm 2.5-3
Eh I'm not even in that state
Like I'm not down to try
But maybe that's just because don
too nervous
WHo knows
Not how it works though
Doesn't mean frequency
means amplitude
Well means both
Nice!!
Haha
Where?
I come to date
With decoy mustache
Oh really
Nice
Yes
Does chaima do LSD?
K
I'm not gonna tho
Moto tomorrow
FRI 2:09PMYes
Wait meet at 5:15
Where?
Still at ipot
Leaving
Where?
Ari's Location
Not sure
Not soon
Haha yeah
Probably
Lol
I thought you meant no Jenny
I see. We can def arrange Bros only night too. But I don't think that would work tonight
Hahahaha no I get why it's scary
It's something you don't want to touch
Ikd
Idk
Had a dream about ghosts once
Kept trying to touch me
So I talked to Kartik about how he deals with nested functions and syntax
He said the goal is to conceptually understand the code
He can infer where the curly braces are just be understanding the logic
So it doesn't really read out the syntax to him
It just reads the word parts
And he knows the language
So can guess what it actually looks like
Same for closures
Like he can conceptually tell by how the code works what a closure would be
Right so then he can turn on the syntax
It even has a mode where it reads out how many spaces there are before the line
I'm on call
Fuck kinda want to try it if we go camping
No like I might take Jenny camping
It is July 4-11
I might wanna get more
I wish I got contact info?
Maybe I can trip while you do shrooms?
Tell who?
Where?
So no hangout?
Just went to bar
Hung with Connie and Jenny
Yeah
Can you send me your camping list?
Yes of shit to bring
The Google doc
There wasn't a camping checklist for Costco?
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P2qpnkJvyEpqHHzkUOBeBlCIlGH_YLT5q87f-xx6HPI/edit
Supplies for Camping
Essentials Tents Emily Brings one (fits 3) + Ari buy one Sleeping bags Newspapers for kindling Emily Airmattresses Robin bring a bunch? Swimming trunks Everyone bring their own towel Food Burger Patties Costco Hotdogs Costco Hotdog buns Costco Marshmallow...

He seems to operate just as fast as any normal eng
Wait Jason

New team is fun
Fun but not super partt
Chill people and technically very strong
But not opinionated or arrogant
But not super broey or anything
Manager invited us to come chill at his house though
I wish was more down to party
But good for career development in long term
I mean never asked. But not part of culture
Everyone leaves at 6pm
Lol true
Idk why
Maybe will try soon
Kinda new to team so don't want to try it yet
But maybe in 1-2 weeks when people get back from OOO
To get drinks
It's a step
It's never gonna be Uber 2015
No plans
Why?
Nah on call
Can I invite the blind intern to oysters?
