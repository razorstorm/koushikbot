Ari
Unless talking about EM
Jason
what
no
what does real plane have to do with quantum entanglement
Ari Falkner
When you throw non real numbers into problems usually done with reals
That's a good way of modeling quantum behavior
Jason
what
no
what are you talking about
give me example wehre that works
Ari Falkner
Hmmm
I'm bullshitting
Jason
LOL
#lie #scam rn
Ari Falkner
There's rumors about something related to Uber
Something big
Jason
fuk
ipo?
if ipo I buy house
Ari Falkner
Takes a year lol
But like not exactly an IPO
Jason
what then
Ari Falkner
I tell tonight
Jason
Jason
I was on my phone but still paying attention
saw a wheel chair person so I stepped out of way while still on phone
she passes by and goes
PLEASE PAY ATTENTION
you know what fuck off
Ari Falkner
Did you say that to her?
Jason
it's one of the most people annoying things people do
when like they see someone doing something
but tel them to do it anyway
my dad used to do that
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Jason
like id be cleaning up and he's like
make sure to clean up!
and I'm like wtf
I'm not gonna clean anymore
Ari Falkner
That's reasonable
Because he might see you and think you're just doing your plate
So he's like making sure you do the whole thing
Jason
no like I was cleaning my room
Ari Falkner
Oh
My mom did something kinda similar
But she would justify things after I agreed
Jason
like what
Ari Falkner
"can you clean up the living room?"
"sure Mom"
Jason
o ya LOL
Ari Falkner
"it's just that I'm super stressed out right now and can't keep doing everything myself"
Guilt tripping is only useful when someone doesn't want to do something
Jason
LOL ya
I know why she does it
Ari Falkner
Now I feel guilty and shitty and I was gonna do it anyway
Jason
cuz she wants to establish that it's good to do for next time as well
but the proper way to do it would be like
thanks for agreeing!
I really appreciate when you do these things for me
cuz I'm stressed rn
or sketjkng
something
Ari Falkner
Yeah
What think?

oh ya
i heard about time cubes
could they be used to harness energy?
since they can move without any apparent energy input
Ari Falkner
No
The time cube doesn't rotate
Earth rotates within the timecube
Jason

Really?

Why does Ryan ignore?

he doesn't want you to invite
it's fine just don't invite
why is big deal
Ari Falkner
Won't trust me but believes in invisible Man in the sky
Jason

what we talking about
Ari Falkner
Every Sunday he gets up early and goes to this big room
He listens to some decrepit old backwards guy
Talk about man walking on water
Guy splitting the sea
A psychopathic god
Jason

read this chat
Ari Falkner
He sings music that has less rhythmic ingenuity than twinkle twinkle Little star
Jason
yaaas
jline

Ari Falkner
He sings about how he likes being controlled by an entity more angry, more arbitrary, and more backwards than he

Ari Falkner
Is Pandora bar 21+?
Jason
dont know
who are you trying to invite
Ari Falkner
Same person
But she's 20
So probably can't
Only reason wanted to with Ryan's event was because she leaves soon
Jason
just hang out with her then
like not to these events
Ari Falkner
Lol true
It just kinda feels shitty to not ever be able to bring my own friend to events
Jason
because your friends are brae
this one might not be
but normally they are
Ari Falkner
So like I can't ever bring friends ever to an event?
Jason
you can if you ask the host and the host says yes
thats how it always works
if you are always hosting events
and i always ask if i can bring singing park
and you always say no
im not gonna hold that against you
its your event and singing is brae
Ari Falkner
What does "these events" mean?
Jason
these events
the 2 we are talking about right now
ryans and karaoke
ryan said no
not my fault he said no
hes allowed to say no
Ari Falkner
Yeah not saying he isn't
Jason
karaoke i didnt say no nor yes
Ari Falkner
Oh okay
Jason
you said yourself you cant bring her
i didnt even give you my opinion yet
Ari Falkner
I agree I went overboard with the Ryan event
Jason
im just saying
if you want to hang out with her before she leaves
Ari Falkner
I thought you mean that I can't bring friends to events in general that you and Ryan host
Jason
you can just hang out with her
when did i say that
as long as you ask
and if they are cool im ok with it
they arent always cool though
Ari Falkner
"just hang out with her then
like not to these events"
Jason
yes
not to these events
we said 2 events
and i said these events
aljso generally speaking
people dont bring friends to events
Ari Falkner
I thought you mean like "you can hang with your friends but don't invite them to events me and Ryan generally host/organize"
Jason
not being able to bring friends to events is the norm
being allowed to bring them is unique
if you host an event im typically not gonna bring someone unless i ask you
unless like its someone we all know very well
like if you brought roobin
i wouldnt even notice
thats diff tho
Ari Falkner
Right I'm not saying asking is unreasonable
I thought you were categorically saying "Don't bring your friends to the events I organize"
Of course you should always ask
Jason
loool
didnt say that
Ari Falkner
Oh okay
Jason
chaima af
but i think
part of why ryan said no
is that all of us feel a bit burned lately
cuz of people like jenny
showing up and ruining the fun
ok ruining fun is a bit extreme
but just overall being a negative experience
Ari Falkner
LOL true
But you DID invite her to oysters
Jason
true
guess i didnt realize how brae she was yet at the time
i dont even remember
Ari Falkner
Now I'm kinda mad about it
Jason
about what
Ari Falkner
That I have to deal with tomorrow
Me
Jason
why do you have to deal?
its a large group
thres like 21 people going
Ari Falkner
She will follow me around
Jason
ugh
Ari Falkner
LOL
Jason
i thought shes social and shit
wont she make friends
Ari Falkner
IDK that's true
Jason
eah
i think shes a big poseur
in everything she says
overcompensate af
Ari Falkner
True
Yeah
Jason
not everything
Ari Falkner
Oh BTW
Jason
a lto of things she says
BTW
what
Ari Falkner
Did you ever check if Stephanie liked her?
Jason
oh
no why
didnt think to ask
just ask her next time we see her
shes in alaska on vacation
Ari Falkner
Because when she left she was like "I think Stephanie was super impressed with me"
Jason
but said she wants to smoke with us after shes back
Ari Falkner
Oh hmm
When back?
Jason
so just ask her when shes back
Ari Falkner
Maybe I invite Hannah then
Jason
i dont remmeber
lool
i thought you said hannah leaving soon
Ari Falkner
3 weeks
Jason
hannah
Ari Falkner
Hannah
var stack = new Stack()
l = len(name)
index = 0;
while index < len / 2 {
    stack.push(name[index])
}
Nevermind
I can do this in place
LOL
Jason
yeah
return name
done
LOL
Ari Falkner
No lol
Jason
#justpalindromethings
Ari Falkner
How is that solving it?
Jason
solving wat
her name is same back and forward
can reverse withoout doing anything
ootd
Ari Falkner
Oh I was implementing isPalandrome()
Jason
oh true
yeah just
Ari Falkner
I love how we both thought of the same thing
Jason
for i in xrange(len(name)/2):
    count[name[i]]+=1

for i in xrange(len(name)/2, len(name)):
    count[name[i]]-=1

return sum(count) == 0
O(n) time O(1) space
Ari Falkner
No
This will work with hannha
Jason
oh wait
i was solving diff problem
hahaha
fine
for i in xrange(len(name)/2):
    if name[i] != name[len(name)-i]:
          return False
return True
Ari Falkner
Nice
Gracefully handles differences between even and odd
Jason
yeah because just ignore the middle letter
cuz it dont matta
Ari Falkner
Yeag
Jason
how dare Yeag
>:(
why Yeag
Ari Falkner
Yaeg

You waved at Ari!
JUL 14TH, 7:01PM

Jason

ari read this second paragraph
it explains why all of ubers thrift is optional
Ari Falkner
NO it doesn't.
That's how to not make breaking changes
Jason
ya
Ari Falkner
For the request schema, you can't go required -> optional
Jason
back and forward compatibility is important
Ari Falkner
For the response schema, you can't optional -> require
Jason
no it's saying
Ari Falkner
Think about it this way:
If you add a parameter that is actually required but mark it optional, your code will just break your service
So you'll return a 500 instead of a 400
If it's not actually required by your code it should have never been required in the first place
Jason
wait hold that thought
Robin is coming
he wants to smoke
join?
we can discuss in person
easier than  typing
Ari Falkner
LOL okay sure
When is he coming?
Jason
kk come to my apt
rn he's walking now
Ari Falkner
Okay coming
Jason

Ari Falkner
Is Jenny still there?
Or did she go back to LA?
Jason
no idea
I don't see her
Ari Falkner
Jenny af
Jason
maybe she left don't see her things on the bed anymore
Ari Falkner
NOOOO
Jason
I see girl shoes tho
maybe she's still around
Ari Falkner
Now some random girl in socal is gonna think I'm weird af
Jason
unless Ryan bought them ðŸ˜‰
Ari Falkner
Or you bought them
Jason
kk come
Ari Falkner
Okay coming
Jason
I read just knock door brb
Ari Falkner
This book is bullshit
Jason
chill
its actually really good
if you disagree with the conclusions I've been saying
it's because I made them not the book
also why do people keep saying protobuffs > thrift
Ari Falkner
It is end-to-end ready
Thrift you slap over HTTP
It allows you to use HTTP like an RPC
Protobufs is actually an SOA system designed from the ground up
It's analogous to the tchannel+hyperbahn+thrift suite of software
The difference is that it actually works really well. And it's really, really fast.
Jason
ahh
makes sense
JUL 15TH, 1:37AM

Jason
how is rave
Ari Falkner
Ok
JUL 15TH, 8:31AM

Jason

Ari Falkner
Shabou
Shabou called you.
July 15th, 1:02pm
Call Again
JUL 16TH, 12:04PM

Jason
ugh had frustrating dream
was trying to do work
but a bunch of random people are like being super loud
I kept trying to find a different room to work in but they all had people
got really mad and started yelling at them to shut up
but it didn't work
got increasingly more mad until
started screaming
AAAAAAAAHHHH
and the sound carried super far
and started destroying everything
kinda like ep 2 in legion
Ari Falkner
Oh no
Jason
loool
woke up and was still mad
then took a while to realize just a dream
looll
dumb
Ari Falkner
Hahaha
Jason
haha
Chaima AF
what Alex say
Ari Falkner
???
So confused
Jason
?
you asked him to trip
what he say
Ari Falkner
Oh he said it wouldn't work
Jason
what mean wouldn't work
like scheduling wise?
Ari Falkner
Yeah
He had a conflict
Jason
rent
rekt
maybe next week
ask him
if y'all do I'll join
bring Libbey
Ari Falkner
Then no mushrooms?
Jason
I didn't enjoy it last time but maybe you have better supply now?
Ari Falkner
That is a lot if people tho
Jason
you me alex Libbey?
thats only one more than last time
I think that's better
Ari Falkner
Hmmm
What about shrooms though?
Jason
either is fine
up to you
but then Libbey can't join
Ari Falkner
But if we do shrooms then they do acid the timing will be off
Jason
ya
well see if alex and Libbey are down
if they down we lsd
if not then we shroom
Ari Falkner
Ok
Hmmm
4 people is a lot for acid tho
Jason
why
Ari Falkner
Lol I guess is fine
Jason
wait why does it matter
Ari Falkner
If acid works it can be a very deep emotional experience
It's important for there to be complete trust and confidence
Jason
so why are you inviting alex then
you don't know him well yet
Ari Falkner
Yeah but on a deep level I'm comfortable with him
Jason
also I felt like last time was a negative emotional level
I felt less close to you and Libbey for a few days afterwards
loool
prob just cuz I didn't enjoy it
Ari Falkner
Hmmm
Jason
also I think cuz I didn't know Libbey that well yet
Ari Falkner
You need to let down your barriers and say whatever is on your mind without fear of being judged
Jason
I wasn't afraid of being judged
it just made me frustrated
Ari Falkner
What frustrated you?
Jason
nothing
wait we talked about this
I made me extremely opposed to deeper conversations
Ari Falkner
Yeah. Did you just go with it or were you trying to fight it?
Jason
wasn't trying to do anything
Ari Falkner
Hmmm
Jason
but maybe this time will be better
Ari Falkner
Problem is we hit the deepest part in a sushi shop
Jason
I think also helpful that I know Libbey better now
Ari Falkner
And it was relatively weak
Jason
and are a lot closer
Ari Falkner
Do you trust Alex?
Jason
wasn't because of trust last time
I trust most people by default
it was just more we have better chemistry now than before
Ari Falkner
Ah. I don't
Jason
cuz I didn't understand Libbey humor as well back then as I do now
Ari Falkner
I am deeply suspicious of most people
Jason
so I have more fun hanging out with him now
first coyple times we smoked with Libbey I didn't enjoy as much
but after camping I started really enjoy hanging out with him
Ari Falkner
And Alex?
Jason
I don't know him that well
we don't work together
just chat at lunch sometimes
but he seems cool
Ari Falkner
Ok
But like this trip I might wander away at times
Jason
to look at things?
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Jason
where should we go this time
Ari Falkner
Hmm
Jason
the spot last time was ok but
got too much grass on me
Ari Falkner
I'm gonna ride through Oakland hills
Jason
LOL
Ari Falkner
And see if there's a good spot
Jason
cool
are beaches good too or na
Ari Falkner
Nah
Jason
not interesting enough
Ari Falkner
You won't things with complex geometric patterns
*want
Jason
hmm
would be cool if there are tide pools
with corral
like brain coral and stuff
but those might have too many people
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Jason
o Muir beagh
hella clams and mussels
Ari Falkner
That's the other problem with beaches
Jason
Muir beach
Ari Falkner
Hmm that's true
Jason
ya also don't want to talk to people Yoo much
Ari Falkner
I prefer feeling secluded
Jason
cuz you have to reserve your self a bit more and that's not as fun
ya
Ari Falkner
We talked too much last time
Jason
I enjoyed laughing
oh ya I didn't enjoy you telling me to do things
like look at tree
Ari Falkner
Yeah that was brae
Jason
stop talking
sit here
I was like dude just let me enjoy
our experiences might not be the same
Ari Falkner
True
Sorry about that
Jason

Well you got a week to decide

Ari Falkner
It was mild
Jason
anxiety/feeling of displeasure
oh mine wasnt mild
yours was
i felt it pretty strong
Ari Falkner
Hmmm
Jason
mine waxed and waned
Ari Falkner
After I wandered around
Jason
the part when we were chilling in the sun felt great
but after that
Ari Falkner
Felt like I was wandering through a magical forest
Jason
it wasj ust this baseline level of unease
Ari Falkner
I walked around the ocean
Jason
felt like i couldnt get comfortable
always a bit antsy
i dont like that feeling
Ari Falkner
Yeah that's why I went for a walk
Jason
ah
i think thats another thing
next time if i were to do it again
should do it when im not tired
Ari Falkner
Felt like I was wondering through a beautiful garden
Jason
cuz when i got home i was super tired
and just wanted to sit down
but when i wasnt doing anything felt even more antsy
Ari Falkner
Yeah same
That's why need to be walking in nature
Jason
when we were chililng and looking at the leaves it wasnt as bad
yeah
but cuz was tired
so was hard to walk around
no energy
Ari Falkner
Yeah man it was magical
Jason

Okay mushrooms aren't a plant
Jason
what do you mean they arent a plant
what is definition of plant
mushrooms arent vegetables
plant = vegetable?
Ari Falkner
PLant means photosynthesis
It's interesting because mushrooms return matter and nutrients to the soil
Jason
how do fungi make energy
Ari Falkner
And LSD and shrooms, both fungi, return people back to nature
Jason
nah
they do when you want them to
Jason
yeah i think im not gonna trip this sunday
prob gonna take a break from smoking this week too
unless we have like a large group hanging out and everyone wants to
realized yesterday that just been lazy so far
cuz it's so easy to just smoke or something
like when bored
think
"hmm im bored what should i do? maybe i can do a hobby, maybe ill draw or go for a drive or do some work or read about some stuff, oh but thats a lot of work easier to just smoke"
Ari Falkner
Yeah agreed

Jason
not today I have singing class
Ari Falkner
Is every Monday
Jason
when other times?
damn
Ari Falkner
Idk I'll ask
Jason
kk
Ari Falkner
But probably just Monday
Jason
maybe I'll take an art class and get good again
Ari Falkner
Btw most people get nervous about tripping
But the visions produce a euphoria
That distracts from the underlying unease
Jason
hmm
Ari Falkner
If I trip this Sunday, gonna do two tabs
Jason
o dud
Ari Falkner
But if just Jason
Then I won't do
Jason
why not
Ari Falkner
Same reasons you mentioned
Jason
ah
true
like I don't mind doing it if large group
well medium group is OK too
cuz then it's not a waste of time
cuz hanging out
Ari Falkner
But if you actually are tripping
Don't want to talk that often
Jason
but you still bond
Ari Falkner
Yeah true
Jason
so it's worth something
you get something out of it
Ari Falkner
It's hard because I don't want to talk to people most of the time
Because you need to be quiet to kick in
Jason
actually yesterday I didn't want to talk as much
Ari Falkner
But sometimes you can freak out
Jason
but last time I did
Ari Falkner
So need friends there
Jason
ya
that's why slightly bigger group is good
Ari Falkner
Natives were very careful about how they used them
Jason
so if one person doesn't want to talk
can find another
Ari Falkner
Ture
Jason

The rituals built around using psychedelics makes them magical but comforting
Jason

Ari Falkner
What is?
Tooth containers?
Jason
decoration LOL
at dentist rn
Ari Falkner
Haha
Love it
Jason
chm
Ari Falkner
Do you prefer urban jungle?
Or nice but dense parts of city
Like would you like wall street area
Jason
urban jungle
Ari Falkner
Or like upper west side?
Jason
well fun urban jungle
jungle with stuff to do
Ari Falkner
Sure
Jason
I don't know nyc that well
use sf as example
Ari Falkner
So this is upper west side
Still plenty of things to do

But more stately
Jason
hmm
civic center In a  few years
Ari Falkner
Maybe
But I feel like it will be hipster driven
Upper west side was gradually built over many years
So feels grand and stately
Jason
what does that mean
Ari Falkner
That's why I like Paris
Super old, stately
But dense
Lots to do
Jason
hmm
Uber driver back yesterday was israeli
you enjoi
Ari Falkner
What think?
Israel also has housing crisis
That's probably what's preventing peace with Palestinians tbh

Ari Falkner
Yes
Jason
Yes
MON 11:54PM

Jason
chm
what doi
TUE 11:00AM

Ari Falkner
Should we add our separate friends to the chat?
Jason
yes
well
wait
what do you mean
by separate friends
Ari Falkner
LOL work friends
Jason
oh ok
ari lets do this
you should make a fb event
with a poll on there
and then add people to that
Ari Falkner
Oh true.
Jason
cuz messnger, the poll might get covered up as we talk in it
Ari Falkner
Group chat is better for real-time chat
When actually on the event or night before
Jason
but poll is more async
yeah
exactly
for planning its prob better ot keep group small
Ari Falkner
FB event is good for persistent details
Jason
have a few core people plan things
Ari Falkner
True
Jason
large group chat just get schaotic
Jason
ari change the date to something far out
because if you set it to today
after today people wont be able to click going
fb doesnt let you do anything to past events
it becomes archived
Ari Falkner
True
Thanks for the help
I still take responsibility for all the planning, but made you co-host so you can invite people and change shit
Jason
hhhhhhh
Ari Falkner
Tank
TUE 1:02PM

You waved at Ari!
You and Ari waved at each other!
Jason

tell about Chaim
Ari Falkner
What is chaima salary?
Jason
I tell if you tell comp change
Jason
want hear a secret?
Ari Falkner
What
Jason
want hear or no
Ari Falkner
Yeah but not divulging info online
i tell in person
Jason
it's ~10%
Ari Falkner
not quiet
Jason
want hear secret or no
Ari Falkner
yes
Jason
bercht interviewed at flexport
Ari Falkner
ooooh
how recently?
Jason
today
Ari Falkner
lol
why did he forfeit stocks?
so dumb
Jason
not on purpose
Ari Falkner
???
Jason
he couldnt afford them
what could he do
Ari Falkner
Not leave
Was probably like $2 million?
At least one million
Jason
yeah maybe
prob 5 id say
iunno
cuz he joined a year before me
Ari Falkner
$5 million?
Jason
iunno how many x uber grew in that time
Ari Falkner
Yeah you can probably get loans
Try to sell on secondary market
Anything but sell them!!!
Jason
yeah true
its a lot of risk but is worth
yeah...
i woulda stayed
i mean
but he thought hte opportunity he joined was a sure bet
Ari Falkner
A sure bet of how much money?
Jason
not everything is about money though
maybe he has enough money to be happy
and just wants to do something more meaningful
i mean it didnt work out in the end
but he didnt know that at the time
Ari Falkner
That's a false dichotomy. Not only would waiting be a better compromise between money and opportunity, it also allows more meaning
Like that didn't work out
So now he has to go back to a boring job at flexport
Whereas if he was rich af, he could just afford to start something else
Jason
who said he wants to start a company
he really wanted to work on that specific opportunity
to work with the specific people in that company
Ari Falkner
Ah
Sounded pretty boring tbh
Jason
yeah but iunno
you like what you like
Ari Falkner
It was for mgmt, right?
Jason
yeah
Jason

Jason

WED 12:13AM

Jason
the
WED 10:55AM

Jason
ari wtf
why did you invite james to tripping
Ari Falkner
He kinda invited himself
He's going back to Minnesota though
Jason
i mean i guess it doesnt matter that much cuz im not coming anyway
i woulda been really mad if i was coming to trip
cuz we agreed to only invite close friends
and then someone whos not even just not a close friend but someone i actually cant stand shows up
Ari Falkner
Lol yeah it is my event
But I mostly decided it didn't matter cause you weren't coming and Jason Libbey was for it
Jason
yeah
well i dont care cuz im not going
so you can invite whomever you want
but if i was going that woulda been brae to let him come
despite being your event
thatd be like if i hosted an event and invited vochelle right after you broke up
Ari Falkner
True
Jason
even though is my event i can technically invite whomever i want
its jsut rude to you to do that
but thtas not why i brought it up
cuz im not going it doestn matter
im just surprsied you wanted to invite him
i just thougth that it might be a bad idea
might induce bad trip
Ari Falkner
I didn't!
I know!
Jason
sorry let him come i mean
cuz hes kinda judgy of a person
might have bad vibes
if i were you i woulda just said
oh sorry i kinda wanted to bond with libbey one on one this time
but we can hang out some other time
Ari Falkner
True
Jason
yeah
its not too late to tell him now
Jason

Jenny
Ari Falkner
Oh good
Oh god
Jason
haha
why o god
Jason
SOMETIMES THERE ARE CHAIMAS!
Ari Falkner
Imagine tripping with Jenny
Jason
;)
not much diff than tripping with james tbh
Ari Falkner
The difference is that James isn't as self absorbed
He does like to brag and show off
But he doesn't always just redirect the convo to himself
Jason
hmm
yeah
diff but similar
Ari Falkner
Hmm
They both are a bit unsettling
Jason

Ari Falkner
BTW Redux is actually just a state monad
Jason

WED 6:15PM

Jason
ari
can you reach out to some people in camping trip individually to see if they are down?
cuz if not we should invite some more people
only 2 people said yes so far
3*
err 2*
maybe ask serge and connie
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Jason
kk
well check with people first
so you know a headcount
Ari Falkner

Jason

THU 10:37AM

Jason
did you check if the other people were down for camping?
also we needa fix the ratio
im inviting another friend
but dont want it to be all dudes cuz then shes less likel yto want to come
Ari Falkner
Liang is pretty down
Let me check
Jason
yeah tahts like 1 girl
and like 5 dudes
check with felby
and emily
Ari Falkner
Yeah will do
Jason
kk
should we ask anqi also?
Ari Falkner
Yeah sure
Jason
kk
Ari Falkner
Jacq?
Not angry at her anymore
Jason
im always down to invite jacq if you dont mind
ok
but she doesnt like camping
so prob wont say yes
LOL
which is funny cuz she was a girl scout
Ari Falkner
Haha girl scouts don't camp
Jason
she said they did a lot of shit
Ari Falkner
BTW are you gonna message anqi and jacq?
Jason
i asked anqi ya
Ari Falkner
Cause anqi hates me
Jason
she ahsnt responded yet
wat
she does?
Ari Falkner
No
Just assume all of Jacq's friends hate me
Jason
why
why assume people hate
people hate jenny
people dont hate you
some find you weird
but thats not same as hate
vicky said potentially down
Ari Falkner
True
Jason
but she needs to check
Ari Falkner
No one except for Jason and Connie liked Jenny
haha I messaged Vicki
Jason
jason i can kinda understand
cuz hes really nonjudgemental
he enjoys hanging out with almost anyone
connie im surprised by
but connie is super nice
so i guess shes willing to give jenny a chance
Ari Falkner
I think Jenny was well behaved the night she met Connie
And she's not as bad 1:1
Cause like half of the reason she's brae is because she chooses shit conversation topics
Jason
yeah shes not bad 1:1 which is why im confused
shes not good
but not bad
Ari Falkner
But what really makes people HATE her is when 1. they are against the flow of the conversation 2. when the conversation doesn't change to flow in the direction of the topics no one else wants to talk about, she individually tries to divide the conversation participants by engaging them individually.
Jason
yeah
Ari Falkner
2. is the really brae one. She did it to me when we were dating all the time but I just thought it was because we were dating
Like still brae
But girls sometimes do that
And was just gonna take her up on it later
But like didn't realize she did it to everyone
Jason
nah
not all girls do that
like angie does that
but i think that was one of her worst qualities
Ari Falkner
Yeah Angie does it a lot
Jason
its something i really dont like about her
Ari Falkner
But not as fiercely as Jenny
Jason
i used to think it was sad that we were drifting apart
cuz we used to be pretty close
but then i realized
nah
its not worth keeping that friendship
Ari Falkner
Yeah same
Jason
shes just kinda brae
Ari Falkner
And the topics she does it with aren't bad though
Jason
yeah
shes not nearly as brae
i dont hate angie
if she hit me up id almost always say yes
but i dont want to put in that much effort
Ari Falkner
Yeah same
Jason
tue
http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7873783/linkin-park-chester-bennington-suicide
Ari Falkner
Damn

Jason

no*
Ari Falkner
It has a shower facility
Jason

Ari Falkner
No it doesn't.
But nearby
Jason
how near
Jason

Ari Falkner
Liang's friend
Jason
are they fob
Ari Falkner
Why did I invite Jing camping?
Jason
what
Ari Falkner
Liang = Jing
Jason
are they fob?
Ari Falkner
Looks wise
Eh
Can't say about yichen
Jason
don't care about looks
just personaluty
don't want the dynamic to be weird
if the two of them just gonna talk in Chinese in a   corner
Ari Falkner
No
Liang is fobby in the sense that she's a bit quiet and speaks in a Chinese accent
Jason
hmm
I want to make sure everyone there enjoys it
or else they will be less likely to agree to hang out with us next time
Ari Falkner
She's quiet
But not anti social
Jason
that's god
good
Ari Falkner
Participates in conversations and stuff
Jason
cool
Ari Falkner
Just doesn't always contribute the most
Like she's nods and reacts and occasionally pipes in
But isn't like super loud
Haha
Jason
so kinda like guy Liang
actually nah
Ari Falkner
Nah
Jason
guy Liang is pretty talkative
Ari Falkner
Xiaowei?
Jason
xiaowei is pretty talkative too
like if her english skills are as good as ours shed be as talkative as ours
i can tell she enjoys talking
Ari Falkner
Yeah true. Hmm, maybe Austin level
Like not social skills of Austin
Frequency of him
Jason
haha
i mean as long as they arent weird
its cool
Ari Falkner
Or bin
Jason
ah yeah
thats cool then

Jason
chaima
THU 3:48PM

Jason
kath and i were discussing yesterday
whther libbey is bi
she thinks he is
i dont think so
thoughts
Ari Falkner
Oh hmmm
No not
Like he's not the guy who wouldn
't consider it and maybe experiment a little
He's a curious and adventurous person
But like I don't think he is any less straight than the rest of us
Jason
thats what i kinda feel too
like he might be down
Ari Falkner
I told you before that I'm not completely straight
Jason
but not like outright looking for it
Ari Falkner
But still not down to try it
Jason
ah
im like completely not for it
ive never even considered it
Ari Falkner
Yeah
Question is
Jason
wehreas i think you are a bit curious
Ari Falkner
Am I a bit bi? Or are you just like super straight?
Jason
im like not at all
iuno
well if there was a scale from 0 to 10
Ari Falkner
That's the question
Jason
im def lower on scale than you
Ari Falkner
I'm like a 7 or 7.5
Jason
i think most people are closer than to you than to me
?
no like
0 is completely straight
10 is completely gay
5 is completely bi
Ari Falkner
Oh then I'm 2.5-3
Jason
id be a full on 0
yeah
i think most straight people are prob closer to like 2 to 3 range
like not really for it but if someone really hot comes along might be down to try
whereas im just like nope
not at all
Ari Falkner
Eh I'm not even in that state
Like I'm not down to try
But maybe that's just because don
Jason
so you prob not 2-3 then
you prob a 1 then
Ari Falkner
too nervous
WHo knows
Jason
cuz think about it
a 5 is someone who actively goes around dating/sleeping with both genders
2-3 is literally prefers guys to women at a 1 to 3 ratio
Ari Falkner
Not how it works though
Doesn't mean frequency
means amplitude
Well means both
Jason
i didnt say frequency
THU 5:55PM

JUN 29TH, 9:59AM

Jason
had a dumb nightmare
i was a third party in the dream
like watching some other people do stuff
was like this dude and a girl
hes like hitting on her
but they are both super brae
like their apt is dirty af
super cluttered and disorganized etc
anyway the girl had this brae af cat
taht just scratches everyone and makes a mess
and he like kissed her
and she was like what
and hes like sorry about that
and shes like oh no its fine
and they started making out
adn then shes like wait
wait if we do this you have to take care of my cat tomorrow cuz im out of town
and hes like ok fine but if i take care of your cat you have to iron my clothes
and shes like ok fine but you hav eto clean up my apt
and hes like yeah but you ahve to cook me dinner
etc
and they like debated this for a long time
and came to a long compromise
and then next day
he was taking care of cat
i was watching still
and it started scratching him
and made his leg bleed
and im like omg
fuck this cat
so i stepped in
got a cattle prod
and started electricuting the cat every time it misbehaved
LOL
but it wasnt working
so i was like ok
got a buckt of cold water
i was liek ill dunk it in the water if it misbehaves again
it started screeching loudly
so i grabbed it and was about to dunk it in the bucket
but then i realized it had 4 eyes
like OO OO
like that
and i freaked out
i was like THATS SO GROTESQUE
WTFFF
and flung the cat across the room and woke up
LOL
and was like panting when i woke up from the shock
then i realized
wait
why is that scary
its kinda weird but not that scary
LOL
Ari Falkner
Hahahaha no I get why it's scary
It's something you don't want to touch
Jason
yeah
but its not like wake up panting level of scary tho
Ari Falkner
Ikd
Idk
Had a dream about ghosts once
Kept trying to touch me
Jason
loool
Ari Falkner
So I talked to Kartik about how he deals with nested functions and syntax
He said the goal is to conceptually understand the code
He can infer where the curly braces are just be understanding the logic
So it doesn't really read out the syntax to him
It just reads the word parts
And he knows the language
So can guess what it actually looks like
Same for closures
Like he can conceptually tell by how the code works what a closure would be
Jason
thats fine
but what about debugging syntax errors?
thta only works if you assuem the code you are reading is always 100% correct
but when hes coding what if he makes a typo
or is there a "debug mode" where it reads everything
Ari Falkner
Right so then he can turn on the syntax
Jason
ahh cool
Ari Falkner
It even has a mode where it reads out how many spaces there are before the line
Jason
true
JUN 29TH, 2:16PM

Jason

Jason
daydreaming about making sf a fascist utopia LOL
raise building limits to the edge of space
Ari Falkner
Definitely done that before
Jason
tax any buildings that are less than 40 stories
build 3 layer deep subways with entrances at every street corner
execute anyone who opposes
round up the people shooting up in muni stations and put them into forced rehab center
and force them to clean up the city during day
but provide food and shelter and medical help to get them to clean up
if not clean after 1 year execute
change all build fees to fast track only except for one lane off to the side so it doesn't block traffic
sell fast trak devices off to the side so out of Towner's can buy without blocking traffic
violation for going through fastrak without a device is $1000
and goes up exponentially each time you violate
double parking on Sundays in mission is harshly punished
install smart sensors to automatically ticket anyone who double park for more than a minute or two
raise speed limits on 101 to 85
remove speed limits on 280
with a minimum speed of 80 enforced by speed cameras
(except in traffic of course)
completely reevaluate spending
find all the inefficiencies
execute everyone involved in the inefficiencies
install sensors to issue tickets to excessive honking
you can appeal with dashcam footage if the honking was necessary
serial offenders are executed
red light cameras for cyclists running red lights
exponentially increasing fees up to execution
of course
breaking and entering into cars is immediate execution
all executions also include the state confiscating all personal assets and distributing to all citizens in form of tax credit proportional to their normal tax burden
oh ban taxis
mandatory vocational training for all homeless
execution if no marketable skills can be learned after 2 years
Ari Falkner
This is approaching eugenics
Jason
all people who opposed housing development because of wanting to preserve their views will be blinded by the state
stabbing their eyes out
enjoy your view now
mandatory educstional requirements before voting
public bathrooms will be at least every 5 blocks
public urination and defecation is exponential fine up to execution
can appeal on grounds of medical emergencies
trash cans every block
littering is exponential.fine up to execution
all venues are allowed to open to 6 am
all licensed stores are allowed to sell recreational marijuana immediately
LSD MDMA etc are legalized but restricted
anyone over a certain age may buy a certain amount per time period
legalized prostition in certain districts
iunno maybe the dog patch nothing much there anyway
casino as well
mandatory background checks and psych eval etc for access to weapons
but certain designated ranges where any weapons may be shot
fucking want to shoot a bunker buster at a car? pay enough money and go for it
sf already pretty progressive on the social issues front do not too much needs to be done there
maybe jail a few shitty journalists to send a message
this totally wouldn't work
but is fun to think about
Jason
o also build a nuclear powerplant
and use that for all power needs
guess what happens to the protestors
build a storage facility for the spent nuclear fuel rods
executions are conducted by forcing people into that storage facility without protection
efficiency

Chaima stories when
JUL 3RD, 11:58AM

Jason
funny dream
we were at ava
you and libbey and jenny were hanging out in your apt
and i came over
and you were discussing some one you know
some girl who's like i forgot why
either like super abusive family or like
got into trouble with cops
or something i forget
but basically she's kinda in danger
and you were discussing diff options to help her
and im like wtf
no half measures
if we gonna help her we help her right
cant just leave her like that
and im like i got an idea
we fake her death
so i got some poison that makes you appear dead for hours
and then you wake back up
so her family is over
being abusive again
i snuck her the pill
she secretly took it and "died"
everyone freaked out
her family like left to go find help
and then meanwhile some 2 other people came
and we were like wait they are in on it
lets use this short amount of time to set the plan in motion
so i looked out the window and i threw her body out the window
you wre like
W T F
she gonna die for reals
and im like look outside
and you look and see a bunch of mattresses laid on the ground
that caught her fall
and im like dude i planned ahead
so then right afterwards before we had a chance to carry her to safety
she got swept up by some other people
and taken to a fortress
and im like ok lets plan this out
and think things through first
and then suddnely you were like
uhhh
remember vochelle
for some reason she got involved
and shes storming the fortress by herself
and im like god damnit wtf
(ok at this point in the dream there were like 5 other of these "plans" going on simultaneously, i'll cut out these details for the story to make more sense)
so i was like aite you know what
i gotta work on these other plans too but fuck it
this is fun af
i ran to my shelf grabbed a rifle and said fuck it lock and load
and i ran off
i told you to get me an airvac afterwards
i drove to the fortress
and put on a high tech suit
HUD and shit
and stormed the fortress
then a long ass battle scene played out
the enemies were like protoss from starcraft
all kinda advanced tech aliens
oh the rifle also had a grenade launcher attachment
i rmemeber this one corridor
the neemies were coming at me super fast
and i couldnt kill them all fast enough
so i had to back up and grenade them once in a while
and i said to msyelf
note to self need to bring a flamethrower next time
and then some alien came up and was like
oh man so true
and im like wtf
and then it turned into libbey
LOL
so we fought through the rest of it
and you showed up to take us further
and you said you actually found out where shes hiding
and i said aritellquick
but you wouldnt tell quick
and libbeys like ok i got just the thing
and i said to you
just wait hes gonna go find some protoss mind control device to force you to tell
he came back
and instead of mindcontrol device just brought back some weed
LOL
i wasl ike goddamnit this isnt helpful
then i realized
the girl we are saving is actulaly a dark templar
in starcrat 2 dark templars can combine to make a dark archon who can mind control
and im like ugh if i knew where she was i can have her mind contorl you to tell me where she is
dependency cycle af rn
and then woke up i think
